Man goes to see the Rabbi.

"Rabbi, something terrible is happening and I have to talk to you about it."

The Rabbi asked, "What's wrong?"

The man replied, "My wife is poisoning me."

The Rabbi, very surprised by this, asks, "How can that be?"

The man then pleads, "I'm telling you, I'm certain she's poisoning me, what should I do?"

The Rabbi then offers, "Tell you what. Let me talk to her, I'll see what I can find out and I'll let you know."

A week later the Rabbi calls the man and says, "Well, I spoke to your wife. I spoke to her on the phone for three hours. You want my advice?"

The man anxiously says, "Yes."

"Take the poison," says the Rabbi.

One day there was a man who was walking through the forest and got lost. He wandered around for over a week, and was beginning to starve.

He spotted a Bald Eagle who had just caught a fish and chased it, hoping to get it to drop the fish so he could eat it. Then he saw the bird land on a tree stump not far from him, so he picked up a stone to toss at it — hoping the bird would be frightened and fly away without the fish. But, weak as he was, his aim was off and he hit the poor bird square on the head, and killing it.

"Well," he thought to himself, "no sense letting it go to waste, if I leave it here it will just rot, and it could save my life if I eat it."

So, he built himself a little fire — using a couple of stones — and cooked the eagle to eat. While it was cooking a ranger stumbled upon the man, and when he saw what he was up to, he immediately arrested him — because as you know, that is quite illegal!

The man told the ranger what had happened, and asked for a trial so he could explain the situation to a judge.

So, the day of his trial he told the judge, "Please your Honor, it was a life or death situation! I was lost and starving, and I didn't mean to harm the bird — I only wanted the fish! And when I accidentally killed it, well, I felt terrible but couldn't see any reason to let it go to waste!"

The judge listened to the man's story and deemed him, "Not guilty, on the grounds of extenuating circumstances."

The man was very grateful, and thanked the judge for his fairness.

Then, the judge leaned over and quietly asked the man, "Just between you and me, what DOES a Bald Eagle taste like anyway??"

The man contemplated this for a moment and then spoke, "Well, it's kind of hard to explain … but, I would say somewhere between a California Condor and a Spotted Owl."

On a busy surgical floor the doctor stops the nurse to brief her on a patient's condition. "This patient is a fellow physician and my favorite golf partner. His injury is serious and I fear he will not be able to play golf again unless you follow my orders exactly."

The doctor then began listing orders, "You must give an injection in a different location every twenty minutes followed by a second injection exactly five minutes after the first. He must take two pills at exactly every hour followed by one pill every fifteen minutes for eight hours. He must drink no more and no less than ten ounces of water every twenty-five minutes and must void between. Soak his arm in warm water for fifteen minutes then place ice for ten minutes and repeat over and over for the rest of the day. Give range of motion every thirty minutes. He requires a back rub and foot rub every hour. Feed him something tasty every hour. Be cheerful and do whatever he asks at all times. Chart his condition and vital signs every twenty minutes. You must do these things exactly as I ordered or his injury will not heal properly, and he will not able to play golf well."

The nurse left the doctor and entered the patient's room. She was greeted by anxious family and an equally anxious patient. All asked the nurse what the doctor had said about the patient. The nurse started, "The doctor said that you will live." Then quickly reviewing the orders, the nurse added, "But you will have to learn a new sport."

Once upon a time, a perfect man and a perfect woman met. After a perfect courtship, they had a perfect wedding. Their life together was, of course, perfect.

One snowy, stormy Christmas Eve, this perfect couple was driving their perfect car (a Grand Caravan) along a winding road, when they noticed someone at the side of the road in distress. Being the perfect couple, they stopped to help.

There stood Santa Claus with a huge bundle of toys. Not wanting to disappoint any children on the eve of Christmas, the perfect couple loaded Santa and his toys into their vehicle.

Soon they were driving along delivering toys. Unfortunately, the driving conditions deteriorated and the perfect couple and Santa Claus had an accident. Only one of them survived the accident.

The brain teaser question is: Who was the survivor?

(Scroll down for the answer.)

















The perfect woman survived. She's the only one who really existed in the first place. Everyone knows there is no Santa Claus and there is no such thing as a perfect man.

******Women stop reading here. That is the end of the joke. ******** ***********Men keep scrolling.**************



















So, if there is no perfect man and no Santa Claus, the perfect woman must have been driving. And that explains why there was a car accident.

By the way, if you're a woman and you're reading this, this illustrates another point: Women never listen, either.

A Sunday School teacher asked her class of young children a very simple question, or so she thought. She asked, "What is Easter?"

Immediately many children raised their hands. So the teacher called on one to answer the question.

The sweet child replied, "Oh, that's easy! It's the holiday in November when everyone gets together, eats turkey, and are thankful."

"Wrong!," replied the teacher, and proceeded to choose a second child to answer the same question, "What is Easter?"

The second child replied, "Easter is the holiday in December when we put up a nice tree, exchange presents, and celebrate the birth of Jesus."

The teacher looked at the second child, shook her head, and tells him he's wrong.

Then a third child is selected to answer the question, "What is Easter?"

The third child smiles confidently and looks into the teacher's eyes and says, "I know what Easter is."

"Oh?" says the teacher, incredulously.

"Easter is the Christian holiday that coincides with the Jewish celebration of Passover. Jesus and his disciples were eating at the last supper and Jesus was later deceived and turned over to the Romans by one of his disciples. The Romans took him to be crucified and he was stabbed in the side, made to wear a crown of thorns, and was hung on a cross with nails through his hands. He was buried in a nearby cave, which was then sealed off by a large boulder."

The teacher smiles broadly with delight.

Then the child continues, "Every year the boulder is moved aside so that Jesus can come out … and, if he sees his shadow, there will be six more weeks of winter."

A young boy came to Sunday School late. His teacher knew that he was usually very prompt and asked him if anything was wrong.

The boy replied no, that he was going fishing but his dad told him that he needed to go to church. The teacher was very impressed and asked the boy if his dad had explained to him why it was more important to go to church than to go fishing,

To which the boy replied, yes he did, dad said he didn't have enough bait for both of us.

A young man was visiting his brother and sister-in-law and was surprised to find his young nephew, Timmy, helping them bake the cupcakes. After they were done, his sister-in-law allowed Timmy to put the icing on. When he had finished, he brought them to the table.

"The cupcakes look delicious, Tim." his uncle said. And he took a bite while looking at the other cupcakes. "Timmy these are so good."

As he finished one and took another he again complimented his little nephew. "The cupcakes look beautiful, Tim," his uncle said. "How did you get them iced so evenly?" And he took a large bite while waiting for the answer.

His nephew replied, "I licked them."

One man was explaining to another why he fired his secretary: Two weeks ago, it was my 45th birthday. I wasn't feeling too hot when I got up that morning, you know, another year older, and everything. Anyway, I went down to breakfast knowing that my wife would be pleasant and say "Happy Birthday" and probably have a present for me, but she didn't even say "Good Morning." I thought, "Well, that's great, certainly the children will remember." The children came into breakfast and didn't say a word.

By the time I got to the office, I was feeling very low and despondent. As I walked in my secretary, Janet said, "Good Morning!…Happy Birthday!" Then I felt a little better that someone remembered.

About noon she knocked at the door and said,"You know, it's such a beautiful day outside, and it's your birthday. Let's go out to lunch, just you and me."

So I said, "That's the best thing I've heard all day. Let's go."

We went to lunch. But we didn't go to the place we usually went to. Instead we went to a little place in the country, which was more private. We had two drinks, and lunch was tremendous. I enjoyed it a lot. On the way back to the office, she said,"You know, it's such a beautiful day. Do we have to go back to the office?" I said, "No, I guess not." She said, "Good, my apartment isn't too far from here. Let's go over and I'll fix you another drink."

So we went to her apartment and had another drink. She said, "If you don't mind, I think I'll go into the bedroom and change into something more comfortable." I said,"OK" as I didn't mind a bit.

She went into the bedroom, and in about five mintues she came out of the bedroom carrying a large birthday cake, followed by my wife and children, and they were all singing "Happy Birthday."

And there I sat with nothing on but my socks!

Nine-year-old Joey was asked by his mother what he had learned in Sunday School.

"Well, Mom, our teacher told us how God sent Moses behind enemy lines on a rescue mission to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. When he got to the Red Sea, he had his engineers build a pontoon bridge, and all the people walked across safely. He used his walkie-talkie to radio headquarters and call in an air strike. They sent in bombers to blow up the bridge and all the Israelites were saved."

"Now, Joey, is that REALLY what your teacher taught you?" his mother asked.

"Well, no, Mom, but if I told it the way the teacher did, you'd never believe it!"

A lady wakes up one morning to find a gorilla in her tree. She looks in the phone book and finds a gorilla removal service.

When she asks if they can remove the gorilla, the service guy asks, "Is it a male or female?" "Male," she replies. "Oh yeah, we can do it. I'll be right there," he states.

An hour later, the service guy shows up with a stick, a Chihuahua, a shotgun, and a pair of handcuffs.

He then gives the woman some instructions. "I'm going to climb this tree and poke the gorilla with the stick until he falls out of the tree. When he does, the trained Chihuahua will go to bite the gorilla's testicles off. The gorilla will then cross his hands to protect himself, allowing you to put the handcuffs on him."

The woman asks, "What do I do with the shotgun?" The service guy replies, "If I fall out of the tree before the gorilla does, shoot the Chihuahua."

Woods replies: "Not too bad, I've had some problems with my swing, but I think I've got that right now. "Stevie Wonder says: "I always find that when my swing goes wrong, I need to stop playing for a while and not think about it. Then, the next time I play, it seems to be all right. Tiger Woods says: "You play golf?" Stevie Wonder says: "Oh, yes, I've been playing for years." And Woods says: "But, you're blind How can you play golf if you're blind?" Wonder replies: "I get my caddy to stand in the middle of the fairway and call to me. I listen for the sound of his voice and play the ball towards him. Then, when I get to where the ball lands, the caddy moves to the green or farther down the fairway, and again I play the ball towards his voice." "But, how do you putt?", asks Woods. "Well," says Stevie, "I get my caddy to lean down in front of the hole and call to me with his head on the ground and I just play the ball towards his voice." Woods asks: "What's your handicap?" Stevie says, "Well, I'm a scratch golfer." Woods, incredulous, says to Stevie: "We've got to play a round sometime." Wonder replies: "Well, people don't take me seriously, so I only play for money, and never play for less than $10,000 a hole." Woods thinks about it and says, "OK, I'm game for that, when would you like to play?" Stevie says, "Pick a night!"

A large, well established, Canadian lumber camp advertised that they were looking for a good lumberjack.

The very next day, a skinny little man showed up at the camp with his axe, and knocked on the head lumberjacks' door. The head lumberjack took one look at the little man and told him to leave.

"Just give me a chance to show you what I can do," said the skinny man.

"Okay, see that giant redwood over there?" said the lumberjack. "Take your axe and go cut it down."

The skinny man headed for the tree, and in five minutes he was back knocking on the lumberjack's door. "I cut the tree down," said the man.

The lumberjack couldn't believe his eyes and said, "Where did you get the skill to chop down trees like that?"

"In the Sahara Forest," replied the puny man.

"You mean the Sahara Desert," said the lumberjack.

The little man laughed and answered back, "Oh sure, that's what they call it now!"

A Mississippian came home and found his house on fire, he rushed next
door, telephoned the fire department and shouted,
"Hurry over here. My house is on fire!" "OK," replied the fireman, "how do we
get there?" "Shucks, don't you still have those big red trucks?"

If you love something, set it free. If it comes back, it will always be yours. If it doesn't come back, it was never yours to begin with. But, if it just sits in your living room, messes up your stuff, eats your food, uses your telephone, takes your money, and doesn't appear to realize that you had set it free … You either married it or gave birth to it.

Insanity is my only means of relaxation.

Reason to smile: Every 7 minutes of every day, someone in an aerobics class pulls a hamstring.

Women over 50 don't have babies because they would put them down and forget where they left them.

One of life's mysteries is how a 2 pound box of candy can make a woman gain 5 lbs.

My mind not only wanders, it sometime leaves completely.

The best way to forget all your troubles is to wear tight shoes.

The nice part about living in a small town is that when you don't know what you're doing, someone else does.

The older you get, the tougher it is to lose weight because by then, your body and your fat are really good friends.

Just when I was getting used to yesterday, along came today.

Sometimes I think I understand everything, then I regain consciousness.

I gave up jogging for my health when my thighs kept rubbing together and setting my pantyhose on fire.

Amazing! You hang something in your closet for awhile and it shrinks two sizes!

Skinny people irritate me! Especially when they say things like, "You know, sometimes I just forget to eat." — Now I've forgotten my address, my mother's maiden name, and my keys. But I've never forgotten to eat. You have to be a special kind of stupid to forget to eat.

A friend of mine confused her valium with her birth control pills. She had 14 kids, but she doesn't really care.

They keep telling us to get in touch with our bodies. Mine isn't all that communicative but I heard from it the other day after I said, "Body, how'd you like to go to the six o'clock class in vigorous toning?" Clear as a bell my body said, "listen witch … do it and die."

The trouble with some women is that they get all excited about nothing and then they marry him.

I read this article that said the typical symptoms of stress are: eating too much, impulse buying, and driving too fast. Are they kidding? That is my idea of a perfect day.

I know what Victoria's Secret is. The secret is that nobody older than 30 can fit into their stuff.

If men can run the world, why can't they stop wearing neckties? How intelligent is it to start the day by tying a noose around your neck?

Send this to five bright women you know and make their day!!!

Patron: Waiter!

Waiter: Hi, my name is Bill, and I'll be your Support. What seems to be the problem?

Patron: There's a fly in my soup!

Waiter: Try again, maybe the fly won't be there this time.

Waiter: Maybe it's the way you're using the soup. Try eating it with a fork instead.

Patron: Even when I use the fork, the fly is still there.

Patron: A SOUP bowl!

Waiter: Hmmm, that should work. Maybe it's a configuration problem. How was the bowl set up?

A plane was taking off from Kennedy Airport. After it reached a comfortable cruising altitude, the captain made an announcement over the intercom, "Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Welcome to Flight Number 293, nonstop from New York to Los Angeles. The weather ahead is good and therefore we should have a smooth and uneventful flight. Now sit back and relax — OH MY GOD!"

Silence.

Then, the captain came back on the intercom and said, "Ladies and Gentlemen, I am so sorry if I scared you earlier, but while I was talking, the flight-attendant brought me a cup of coffee and spilled the hot coffee in my lap. You should see the front of my pants!"

A passenger in Coach said, "That's nothing. He should see the back of mine!"

A young fellow walks into a talent agent's office and says he wants to
break into show-biz, so the agent says "Okay kid, show me what you do."
The kid tells some jokes, does a little soft shoe, sings a bit, does an
acrobatic act with an ottoman, and is good enough to impress the gent.
"Great kid! Just great!," says the agent "I can do things for ya! I
think I can get you a show on T.V." (This was the early sixties.) "By
the way, what's your name? "The young man, proud and excited, exclaims
"Penis Van Lesbian."
"Scuse me?"questions the agent. "My name is Penis Van Lesbian" again
replies the young man.
"Hey I'm sorry kid, you're gonna have to change your name, nobody is
gonna hire you with a name like Penis Van Lesbian."
Well the young man is crestfallen but steadfastly refuses to change his
name,so he leaves to find another agent. A few months later he returns
to the same agent.
"Hey kid! Good to see ya again!" says the agent, "Are ya still looking
for work? Have ya changed your name?"
With his head hanging low the young man replies "Yes. Every agent in
town turned me down because of my name, Penis Van Lesbian. So I've
changed it".
"Great kid, great! What's your new name?"
"Dick Van Dyke."

"Equal" is not always synonymous with "the same." Men and women are created equal. But, boys and girls are not born the same.

1. You throw a little girl a ball, and it will hit her in the nose. You throw a little boy a ball, and he will try to catch it. Then it will hit him in the nose.

2. You dress your little girl in her Easter Sunday best, and she'll look just as pretty when you finally make it to church an hour later. You dress a boy in his Easter Sunday best, and he'll somehow find every mud puddle from your home to the church, even if you're driving there.

3. Boys' rooms are usually messy. Girls' rooms are usually messy, except it's a good smelling mess.

4. A baby girl will pick up a stick and look in wonderment at what nature has made. A baby boy will pick up a stick and turn it into a gun.

5. When girls play with Barbie and Ken dolls, they like to dress them up and play house with them. When boys play with Barbie and Ken dolls, they like to tear off their appendages.

6. Boys couldn't care less if their hair is unruly. If their bangs got cut a quarter-inch too short, girls would rather lock themselves in their room for two weeks than be seen in public.

7. Baby girls find mommy's makeup and almost instinctively start painting their face. Baby boys find mommy's makeup and almost instinctively start painting the walls.

8. If a girl accidentally burps, she will be embarrassed. If a boy accidentally burps, he will follow it with a dozen fake belches.

9. Boys grow their fingernails long because they're too lazy to cut them. Girls grow their fingernails long — not because they look nice — but because they can dig them into a boys arm.

10. Girls are attracted to boys, even at an early age. At an early age, boys are attracted to dirt.

11. By the age of 6, boys will stop giving their dad kisses. By the age of 6, girls will stop giving their dad kisses unless he bribes them with candy.

12. Most baby girls talk before boys do. Before boys talk, they learn how to make machine-gun noises.

13. Girls will cry if someone dies in a movie. Boys will cry if you turn off the VCR after they've watched "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" movie three times in a row.

14. Girls turn into women. Boys turn into bigger boys.

Linda and Marion were comparing notes on the difficulties of running a small business.

"I started a new practice last year," Linda said. "I insist that each of my employees take at least a week off every three months."

"Why in the world would you do that?" Marion asked.

"It's the best way I know of to learn which ones I can do without," Linda replied.

A dad walks into a market followed by his ten-year-old son. The kid is spinning a 25 cent piece in the air and catching it between his teeth. As they walk through the market someone bumps into the boy, at just the wrong moment, and the coin goes straight into his mouth lodging in his throat. He immediately starts choking and going blue in the face and Dad starts panicking, shouting and screaming for help.

A middle-aged, fairly unnoticeable, man in a gray suit is sitting at a coffee bar in the market reading his newspaper and sipping a cup of coffee. At the sound of the commotion, he looks up, puts his coffee cup down on the saucer, neatly folds his newspaper and places it on the counter. He gets up from his seat and makes his unhurried way across the market. Reaching the boy, the man carefully takes hold of the kid's testicles and squeezes gently but firmly. After a few seconds the boy convulses violently and coughs up the 25 cent piece, which the man catches in his free hand.

Releasing the boy, the man hands the coin to the father and walks back to his seat in the coffee bar without saying a word.

As soon as he is sure that his son has suffered no lasting ill-effects, the father rushes over to the man and starts effusively thanking him, saying: "I've never seen anybody do anything like that before. It was fantastic! Are you a doctor?"

"Oh, good heavens, no," the man replies, "I work for the Internal Revenue Service."

No, Windows is not a virus. Here's what viruses do:

1. They replicate quickly — OK, Windows does that.

2. Viruses use up valuable system resources, slowing down the system as they do so — okay, Windows does that.

3. Viruses will, from time to time, trash your hard disk — okay, Windows does that too.

4. Viruses are usually carried, unknown to the user, along with valuable programs and systems. Sigh … Windows does that, too.

5. Viruses will occasionally make the user suspect their system is too slow (see 2) and the user will buy new hardware. Yup, Windows does that, too.

Until now it seems Windows is a virus but there are fundamental differences: Viruses are well supported by their authors, are running on most systems, their program code is fast, compact and efficient and they tend to become more sophisticated as they mature.

So Windows is not a virus.

It's a bug.

An old cowboy dressed to kill with cowboy shirt, hat, jeans, spurs, and chaps went to a bar and ordered a drink. As he sat there sipping his whiskey, a young lady sat down next to him. After she ordered her drink she turned to the cowboy and asked him, "Are you a real cowboy?"

"Well, I have spent my whole life on the ranch herding cows, breaking horses, mending fences … I guess I am," replied the cowboy. After a short while he asked her what she was.

"I've never been on a ranch so I'm not a cowboy, but I am a lesbian. I spend my whole day thinking about women. As soon as I get up in the morning I think of women, when I eat, shower, watch TV, everything seems to make me think of women," said the young lady.

A short while later she left and the cowboy ordered another drink.

A couple sat down next to him and asked, "Are you a real cowboy?"

"I always thought I was but I just found out that I'm a lesbian."

In March 1992 a man living in Newtown near Boston, Massachusetts, received a bill for his as yet unused credit card stating that he owed $0.00. He ignored it and threw it away.

In April he received another and threw that one away too. The following month the credit card company sent him a very nasty note stating they were going to cancel his card if he didn't send them $0.00 by return of post. He called them, talked to them, they said it was a computer error and told him they'd take care of it.

The following month he decided that it was about time that he tried out the troublesome credit card figuring that if there were purchases on his account it would put an end to his ridiculous predicament. However, in the first store that he produced his credit card in payment for his purchases he found that his card had been canceled. He called the credit card company who apologized for the computer error once again and said that they would take care of it.

The next day he got a bill for $0.00 stating that payment was now overdue. Assuming that having spoken to the credit card company only the previous day the latest bill was yet another mistake he ignored it, trusting that the company would be as good as their word and sort the problem out.

The next month he got a bill for $0.00 stating that he had 10 days to payhis account or the company would have to take steps to recover the debt.

Finally giving in, he thought he would play the company at their own game and mailed them a check for $0.00. The computer duly processed his account and returned a statement to the effect that he now owed the credit card company nothing at all.

A week later, the man's bank called him asking him what he was doing writing a check for $0.00. After a lengthy explanation the bank replied that the $0.00 check had caused their check processing software to fail. The bank could not now process ANY checks from ANY of their customers that day because the check for $0.00 was causing the computer to crash.

The following month the man received a letter from the credit card company claiming that his check had bounced and that he now owed them $0.00 and unless he sent a check by return of post they would be taking steps to recover the debt.

The man, who had been considering buying his wife a computer for her birthday, bought her a typewriter instead.

Mr. Adams: You know, Thomas, that wouldn't happen if you'd buy an active-matrix screen.

Mr. Franklin: Hard-disk failure?!? Aw, criminy!

Mr. Livingston: Are you sure it's "unalienable rights"? My spell checker recommends "unassailable".

Mr. Jefferson: Can we stick to the substance of the document, please? Shoot. Low battery. Anyone got a spare power cable?

Mr. Sherman: What have you got, a Toshiba? No, mine isn't compatible.

Mr. Franklin: Hello, PCs Philadelphia? What does it mean when the floppy drive buzzes? OK, I'll hold …

Mr. Livingston: The "In Congress" part here at the top; have you thought about blowing that up really big and maybe centering it in 72 point Helvetica?

Mr. Jefferson: Not a bad idea. Aw, nuts! Word macro virus! I can't save the file.

Mr. Franklin: That's all right, Thomas. We can manage. Here, borrow my quill pen …

At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto industry and stated "If GM had kept up with the technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving twenty-five dollar cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon."

In a response to Mr. Gates' comments, General Motors issued the following press release (by Mr. Welch himself, the GM CEO) "If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics:

1. For no reason whatsoever your car would crash twice daily.

2. Every time they repainted the lines on the road, you would have to buy a new car.

3. Occasionally, executing a maneuver, such as a left turn, would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall the engine.

4. Only one person at a time could use the car, unless you bought "Car95" or "CarNT." But then you would have to buy more seats.

5. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, reliable, five times as fast, and twice as easy to drive.

6. The oil, water, temperature, and alternator warning lights would be replaced by one "general car default" warning light.

7. New seats would force everyone to have the same size bottom.

10. GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of Rand McNally road maps (now a GM subsidiary), even though they neither need nor want them Attempting to delete this option would immediately cause the car's performance to diminish by 50% or more. Moreover, GM would become a target for investigation by the Justice Department.

11. Every time GM introduced a new model car, buyers would have to learn how to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car.

12. You would press the "start" button to shut off the engine.

A father came home from a long business trip to find his son riding a very fancy new 10-speed bike. "Where did you get the money for the bike? It must have cost $300."

"Easy, Dad," the boy replied. "I earned it hiking."

"Come on," the father said. "Tell me the truth."

"That is the truth," the boy replied. "Every night you were gone, Mr. Reynolds from the grocery store would come over to see Mom. He'd give me a $20 bill and tell me to take a hike!"

------

There once was a man named George Thomas, a pastor in a small New England town. One Easter Sunday morning he came to the Church carrying a rusty, bent, old bird cage, and set it by the pulpit. Several eyebrows were raised and, as if in response, Pastor Thomas began to speak. "I was walking through town yesterday when I saw a young boy coming toward me swinging this bird cage. On the bottom of the cage were three little wild birds, shivering with cold and fright. I stopped the lad and asked, "What you got there son?"

"Just some old birds," came the reply. "What are you gonna do with them?" I asked.

"Take 'em home and have fun with 'em, he answered. I'm gonna tease 'em and pull out their feathers to make 'em fight. I'm gonna have a real good time."

"But you'll get tired of those birds sooner or later. What will you do then?"

"Oh, I got some cats, said the little boy. They like birds. I'll take 'em to them."

The pastor was silent for a moment. "How much do you want for those birds, son?"

"Huh??!!! Why, you don't want them birds, mister. They're just plain old field birds. They don't sing — they ain't even pretty!"

"How much?" the pastor asked again.

The boy sized up the pastor as if he were crazy and said, "$10?"

The pastor reached in his pocket and took out a ten dollar bill. He placed it in the boy's hand. In a flash, the boy was gone. The pastor picked up the cage and gently carried it to the end of the alley where there was a tree and a grassy spot. Setting the cage down, he opened the door, and by softly tapping the bars persuaded the birds out, setting them free. Well, that explained the empty bird cage on the pulpit, and then the pastor began to tell this story.

One day Satan and Jesus were having a conversation. Satan had just come from the Garden of Eden, and he was gloating and boasting. "Yes, sir, I just caught the world full of people down there. Set me a trap, used bait I knew they couldn't resist. Got 'em all!"

"What are you going to do with them?" Jesus asked.

Satan replied, "Oh, I'm gonna have fun! I'm gonna teach them how to marry and divorce each other, how to hate and abuse each other, how to drink and smoke and curse. I'm gonna teach them how to invent guns and bombs and kill each other. I'm really gonna have fun!"

"And what will you do when you get done with them?" Jesus asked.

"Oh, I'll kill 'em, Satan glared proudly.

"How much do you want for them?" Jesus asked.

"Oh, you don't want those people. They ain't no good. Why, you'll take them and they'll just hate you. They'll spit on you, curse you and kill you!! You don't want those people!!"

"How much?" He asked again.

Satan looked at Jesus and sneered, "All your tears, and all your blood."

Jesus said, "DONE". Then He paid the price.

The pastor picked up the cage he opened the door and he walked from the pulpit.

Notes:

Isn't it funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world's going to hell.

Isn't it funny how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what the Bible says.

Isn't it funny how everyone wants to go to heaven provided they do not have to believe, think, say, or do anything the Bible says.

Or is it scary?

Isn't it funny how someone can say "I believe in God" but still follow Satan (who, by the way, also "believes" in God).

Isn't it funny how you can send a thousand jokes through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice about sharing.

Isn't it funny how the lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene pass freely through cyberspace, but the public discussion of Jesus is suppressed in the school and workplace.

FUNNY, ISN'T IT?

Isn't it funny how someone can be so fired up for Christ on Sunday, but be an invisible Christian the rest of the week.

Are you laughing?

Isn't it funny how when you go to forward this message, you will not send it to many on your address list because you're not sure what they believe, or what they will think of you for sending it to them.

Isn't it funny how I can be more worried about what other people think of me than what God thinks of me. >>

Knowing that the minister was very fond of cherry brandy, one of the church elders offered to present him with a bottle on one consideration — that the pastor acknowledge receipt of the gift in the church paper.

"Gladly," responded the good man.

When the church magazine came out a few days later, the elder turned at once to the "appreciation" column. There he read: "The minister extends his thanks to Elder Brown for his gift of fruit and for the spirit in which it was given."

Teaching Math in 1960:

A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100. His cost of production
is 4/5 of the price, or $80. What is his profit?

Teaching Math in 1970:

A logger exchanges a set "L" of lumber for a set "M" of money. The
cardinality of set "M" is 100. Each element is worth one dollar. Make
100 dots representing the elements of the set "M". The set "C", the cost of
production, contains 20 fewer points than set "M." Represent the set "C"
as a subset of set "M" and answer the following question: What is the
cardinality of the set "P" for profits?

Teaching Math in 1980:

A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100. Her cost of production
is $80 and her profit is $20. Your assignment: Underline the number 20.

Teaching Math in 1990:

By cutting down beautiful forest trees, the logger makes $20. What do
you think of this way of making a living? Topic for class participation
after answering the question: How did the forest birds and squirrels feel as
the logger cut down the trees? There are no wrong answers.

Teaching Math in 1996:

By laying off 40% of its loggers, a company improves its stock price
from $80 to $100. How much capital gain per share does the CEO make by
exercising his stock options at $80? Assume capital gains are no longer
taxed, because this encourages investment.

Teaching Math in 1997:

A company out-sources all of its loggers. The firm saves on benefits,
and when demand for its product is down, the logging work force can easily be
cut back. The average logger employed by the company earned $50,000, and three
weeks vacation, a nice retirement plan and medical insurance. The
contracted logger charges $50 an hour. Was outsourcing a good move?

Teaching Math in 1998:

A laid-off logger with four kids at home and a ridiculous alimony from
his first failed marriage comes into the logging-company corporate offices and
goes postal, mowing down 16 executives and a couple of secretaries, and
gets lucky when he nails a politician on the premises collecting his kickback.
Was outsourcing the loggers a good move for the company?

Dear Mom,

Our scout master told us all to write to our parents in case you saw the flood on TV and worried. We are OK. Only 1 of our tents and 2 sleeping bags got washed away. Luckily, none of us got drowned because we were all up on the mountain looking for Chad when it happened.

Oh yes, please call Chad's mother and tell her he is OK. He can't write because of the cast. I got to ride in one of the search and rescue jeeps It was neat. We never would have found him in the dark if it hadn't been for the lightning.

Scoutmaster Webb got mad at Chad for going on a hike alone without telling anyone. Chad said he did tell him, but it was during the fire so he probably didn't hear him. Did you know that if you put gas on a fire, the gas can will blow up? The wet wood still didn't burn, but one of our tents did. Also some of our clothes. John is going to look weird until his hair grows back. We will be home on Saturday if Scoutmaster Webb gets the car fixed. It wasn't his fault about the wreck. The brakes worked OK when we left. Scoutmaster Webb said that a car that old you have to expect something to break down; that's probably why he can't get insurance on it. We think it's a neat car. He doesn't care if we get it dirty, and if it's hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the tailgate. It gets pretty hot with 10 people in a car. He let us take turns riding in the trailer until the highway patrolman stopped and talked to us.

Scoutmaster Webb is a neat guy. Don't worry, he is a good driver. In fact, he is teaching Terry how to drive. But he only lets him drive on the mountain roads where there isn't any traffic. All we ever see up there are logging trucks.

This morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming out in the lake Scoutmaster Webb wouldn't let me because I can't swim and Chad was afraid he would sink because of his cast, so he let us take the canoe across the lake. It was great. You can still see some of the trees under the water from the flood. Scoutmaster Webb isn't crabby like some scoutmasters. He didn't even get mad about the life jackets. He has to spend a lot of time working on the car so we are trying not to cause him any trouble.

Guess what? We've all passed our first aid merit badges. When Dave dove in the lake and cut his arm, we got to see how a tourniquet works. Also Wade and I threw up. Scoutmaster Webb said it probably was just food poisoning from the leftover chicken. He said they got sick that way with the food they ate in prison. I'm so glad he got out and became our scoutmaster. He said he sure figured out how to get things done better while he was doing his time.

Have to go now, we are going into town to mail our letters and buy bullets. Don't worry about anything. We are fine.

Love, Camden

P.S. How long has it been since I had a tetanus shot?

The politician was sitting at his campaign headquarters when the phone rang. He listened intently, and after a moment his face brightened.

When he hung up, he immediately phoned his mother to tell her the good news.

"Ma," he shouted, "the results are in. I won the election!"

"Honestly?"

The politician's smiled faded. "Aw hell, Ma, why bring that up at a time like this?"

George Phillips, a civil engineer at UC-Davis, has become a cult hero in the

obsessive subculture of people who collect frequent-flier miles by parlaying

$3,150 worth of pudding into 1.2 million miles. Oh, yeah — he's also going to claim an $815 tax write-off.

Last May, Phillips was pushing his shopping cart down the frozen-food aisle of his local supermarket when a promotion on a Healthy Choice frozen entree caught his eye: He could earn 500 miles for every 10 Universal Product Codes (bar codes) from Healthy Choice products he sent to the company by Dec.31. Even better: Any bar codes mailed by the end of the month would rack up double the mileage, or 1,000 miles for every 10 labels.

"I started doing the math, and I realized that this was a great deal,"he said. "I wanted to take my family to Europe this summer, and this could be the way." Frozen entrees were about $2 apiece, but a few aisles away Phillips found cans of Healthy Choice soups at 90 cents each. He filled his cart with them, and then headed to his local Grocery Outlet, a warehouse-style discount store. And there he hit the mother lode. "They had individual servings of chocolate pudding for 25 cents apiece,"he said. "And each serving had its own bar code on it. I did some more math and decided to escalate my plans." Phillips cleaned the store out-bought every last cup of pudding in the warehouse. He then asked the manager for the addresses of all the other Grocery Outlet in the Central Valley and, with his mother-in-law riding shotgun in his van, spent a weekend scouring the shelves of every store from Davis to Fresno. "There were 10 stores in all," he said. "Luckily, most of them were right off the freeway." He filled his garage to the rafters with chocolate pudding and stacked additional cases in his living room.

But Phillips wasn't finished yet — he had the manager of his local Grocery Outlet order him 60 more cases. "A few days later I went out behind the store," he said, "and there were two whole pallets of chocolate pudding with my name on them." All in all, he'd purchased 12,150 individual servings of pudding. Around this time, Phillips began to reveal his scheme to fellow readers of the Webflyer Web site (www.flyertalk.com < <http://www.flyertalk.com> ) where he posted an account under the name "Pudding Guy." Phillips' tale was met with skepticism, if not outright disbelief, until he uploaded photos of his haul. They're still there, at <http://www.flyertalk.com/pudding.htm> But then Pudding Guy discovered he had a problem on his hands: The eadline for earning double miles was quickly approaching, and there was simply no way Phillips and his wife could tear off all those bar codes in time. "I had to come up with something to do with all that pudding, fast" he said. Phillips trucked the pudding to two local food banks and the Salvation Army, which agreed to tear off the bar codes in exchange for the food donation. "We'd never seen anything like it," said Larry Hostetler, community relations director for the Sacramento Salvation Army. "We've gotten some big donations, but always from companies and institutions, not individual people."

Phillips got his bar codes in the mail in time to beat the deadline, and then held his breath. The promotion specifically said I could get the miles for any Healthy Choice product," he said. "But still, it seemed like there was a good chance they'd get me on some technicality." But then packages-large packages-started arriving in the mail from Healthy Choice. In all, they contained 2,506 certificates, each good for 500 miles. That's 1,253,000 miles. Under the terms of the promotion, Phillips could have the mileage posted in any airline account. He split 216,000 between his United, Delta and Northwest accounts and posted the rest — 1,037,000 miles-to his American Airlines account. By surpassing the million-mile mark, Pudding Guy now has AAdvantage Gold status for life, entitling him to a special reservations number, priorty boarding, upgrades and bonus miles.

While we talked on the phone, Pudding Guy did a little math-as you might have noticed by now, he's very, very good at math-and figured out that scheme netted him enough miles for 31 round-trip coach tickets to Europe, or 42 tickets to Hawaii, or 21 tickets to Australia, or 50 tickets anywhere in the U.S. "Wow — 31 trips to Europe for a little over $3,000," I said. "That's less than $100 a ticket." "Oh, it's better than that," Phillips said. "Since I gave the pudding to charity I can take a tax write-off of $815. So that brings the cost of a ticket to Europe down to $75." As it turns out, Pudding Guy didn't donate all his stash to the food banks. He kept about 100 servings for himself, and he's just about finished them. "Actually," he said, "I really like the stuff." 2000 San Francisco Examiner

Congratulations! You have purchased an extremely fine device that would normally give you thousands of years of trouble-free service, except for the fact that you undoubtedly will destroy it via some typical bonehead consumer maneuver. Which is why we ask you to:

IMPORTANT!

Read This Before Using Your New Device

PLEASE, FOR GOD'S SAKE, READ THIS OWNER'S MANUAL CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU UNPACK THE DEVICE. YOU ALREADY UNPACKED IT, DIDN'T YOU? YOU UNPACKED IT AND PLUGGED IT IN AND TURNED IT ON AND FIDDLED WITH THE KNOBS, AND NOW YOUR CHILD, THE SAME CHILD WHO ONCE SHOVED A POLISH SAUSAGE INTO YOUR VIDEOCASSETTE RECORDER AND SET IT ON "FAST FORWARD", THIS CHILD ALSO IS FIDDLING WITH THE KNOBS, RIGHT? WE MIGHT AS WELL JUST BREAK THESE DEVICES RIGHT AT THE FACTORY BEFORE WE SHIP THEM OUT, YOU KNOW THAT?!?

We're sorry. We just get a little crazy sometimes because we're always getting back "defective" merchandise where it turns out that the consumer inadvertently bathed the device in acid for six days. So, in writing these instructions, we naturally tend to assume that your skull is filled with dead insects, but we mean nothing by it. OK? Now let's talk about:

1. UNPACKING THE DEVICE

The device is encased in foam to protect it from the Shipping People, who like nothing more than to jab spears into outgoing boxes.

PLEASE INSPECT THE CONTENTS CAREFULLY FOR GASHES OR IDA MAE BARKER'S ENGAGEMENT RING, WHICH SHE LOST LAST WEEK, AND SHE THINKS MAYBE IT WAS WHILE SHE WAS PACKING DEVICES.

Ida Mae really wants that ring back, because it is her only proof of engagement, and her fiancee, Stuart, is now seriously considering backing out on the whole thing in as much as he had consumed most of a bottle of Jim Beam in Quality Control when he decided to pop the question. It is not without irony that Ida Mae's last name is "Barker", if you get our drift.

WARNING: DO NOT EVER AS LONG AS YOU LIVE THROW AWAY THE BOX OR ANY OF THE PIECES OF STYROFOAM, EVEN THE LITTLE ONES SHAPED LIKE PEANUTS.

If you attempt to return device to the store, and you are missing one single peanut, the store personnel will laugh at you in the chilling manner exhibited by Joseph Stalin just after he enslaved Eastern Europe.

Besides the device, the box should contain:

* Eight little rectangular snippets of paper that say "WARNING" * A little plastic packet containing four 5/17 inch pilfer grommets and two club-ended 6/93 inch boxcar prawns.

YOU WILL NEED TO SUPPLY: a matrix wrench and 60,000 feet of tram cable.

IF ANYTHING IS DAMAGED OR MISSING: You IMMEDIATELY should turn to your spouse and say "Margaret, you know why this country can't make a car that can get all the way through the drive-through at Burger King without a major transmission overhaul? Because nobody cares, that's why." WARNING: This is assuming your spouse's name is Margaret, and not Harvey.

2. PLUGGING IN THE DEVICE

The plug on this device represents the latest thinking of the electrical industry's Plug Mutation Group, which, in a continuing effort to prevent consumers from causing hazardous electrical current to flow through their appliances, developed the Three-Pronged Plug, then the Plug Where One Prong is Bigger Than the Other. Your device is equipped with the revolutionary new Plug Whose Prongs Consist of Six Small Religious Figurines Made of Chocolate. Connecting this device should only be attempted by a qualified electrician. Lay the power cord gently on the floor near an outlet, but out of direct sunlight, and clean it weekly with a damp handkerchief.

WARNING: WHEN YOU ARE LAYING THE PLUG ON THE FLOOR, DO NOT HOLD A SHARP OBJECT IN YOUR OTHER HAND AND TRIP OVER THE CORD AND POKE YOUR EYE OUT, AS THIS COULD VOID THE WARRANTY.

3. OPERATION OF THE DEVICE

WARNING: WE MANUFACTURE ONLY THE ATTRACTIVE DESIGNER CASE. THE ACTUAL WORKING CENTRAL PARTS OF THE DEVICE ARE MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN. THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE TRANSLATED BY MRS. SHIRLEY PELTWATER OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, WHO HAS NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN TO JAPAN BUT DOES HAVE MOST OF "SHOGUN" ON TAPE.

INSTRUCTIONS: For results that can be the finest, it is our advising that: NEVER to hold these buttons two times!! Except the battery. Next taking the (something) earth section may cause a large occurrence! However. If this is not a trouble, such rotation is a very maintenance action, as a kindly (something) viewpoint from Figure B.

4. WARRANTY

Be it hereby known that this device, together with but not excluding all those certain parts thereunto, shall be warrantied against all defects, failures and malfunctions as shall occur between now and Thursday afternoon shortly before 2, during which time the Manufacturer will, at no charge to the Owner, send the device to our Service People, who will emerge from their caves and engage in rituals designed to cleanse it of evil spirits. This warranty does not cover the attractive designer case.

To which the gentleman said, "Oh, I haven't told my family yet. I just sit around and listen to the conversations. I've changed my will three times!"

A guy walks into a post office one day to see a middle-aged, balding man standing at the counter methodically placing "Love" stamps on bright pink envelopes with hearts all over them. He then takes out a perfume bottle and starts spraying scent all over them.

"But why?" asks the man.

"I'm a divorce lawyer," the man replies.

Here's something everyone should know:

On July 8, 1947, witnesses claim a spaceship with five aliens aboard crashed
on a sheep-and-cattle ranch outside Roswell NM … an incident they say has
been covered up by the military.

On March 31, 1948, exactly nine months after that day, Al Gore was born.

That clears up a lot of things.

A young couple got married and left on their honeymoon. When they got back, the bride immediately called her mother. Her mother asked, "How was the honeymoon?"

"Oh, mama," she replied, "the honeymoon was wonderful! So romantic …"

Suddenly she burst out crying. "But, mama, as soon as we returned Sam started using the most horrible language … things I'd never heard before! I mean, all these awful 4-letter words! You've got to come get me and take me home … Please mama!"

"Sarah, Sarah," her mother said, "calm down! Tell me, what could be so awful? What 4-letter words?"

"Please don't make me tell you, mama," wept the daughter, "I'm so embarrassed they're just too awful! Come get me, please!"

"Darling, baby, you must tell me what has you so upset … Tell your mother these horrible 4-letter words!"

Still sobbing, the bride said, "Oh, mama … words like DUST, WASH, IRON, COOK …!"

An American, a Scot, and a Canadian were in a terrible car accident. They were all brought to the same emergency room, but all three of them died before they arrived. Just as they were about to put the toe tag on the American, he stirred and opened his eyes. Astonished, the doctors and nurses present asked him what happened.

"Well," said the American, "I remember the crash, and then there was a beautiful light, and then the Canadian and the Scot and I were standing at the gates of heaven. St. Peter approached us and said that we were all too young to die, and that for a donation of $50, we could return to the earth. So of course I pulled out my wallet and gave him the $50, and the next thing I knew I was back here."

"That's amazing!" said one of the doctors, "But what happened to the other two?"

"Well, when I left, the Scot was haggling over the price and the Canadian was waiting for the government to pay for his."

Volunteer Fire Department

A fire started on some grassland near a farm in Indiana. The fire department from the nearby town was called to put the fire out.

The fire proved to be more than the small town fire department could handle, so someone suggested that a rural volunteer fire department be called. Though there was doubt that they would be of any assistance, the call was made.

The volunteer fire department arrived in a dilapidated old fire truck. They drove straight towards the fire and stopped in the middle of the flames. The volunteer firemen jumped off the truck and frantically started spraying water in all directions. Soon they had snuffed out the center of the fire, breaking the blaze into two easily controllable parts.

The farmer was so impressed with the volunteer fire department's work and so grateful that his farm had been spared, that he presented the volunteer fire department with a check for $1,000.

A local news reporter asked the volunteer fire captain what the department planned to do with the funds. "That should be obvious," he responded, "the first thing we're gonna do is get the brakes fixed on that stupid fire truck."

Rule One:

If you pull into my driveway and honk you'd better be delivering a
package, because you're sure not picking anything up.

Rule Two:

You do not touch my daughter in front of me. You may glance at
her, so long as you do not peer at anything below her neck. If you
cannot keep your eyes or hands off of my daughter's body, I will remove
them.

Rule Three:

I am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age
to wear their trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off
their hips. Please do not take this as an insult, but you and all of your
friends are complete idiots. Still, I want to be fair and open minded
about this issue, so I propose this compromise: You may come to the door
with your underwear showing and your pants ten sizes to big, and I will
not object. However, in order to ensure that your clothes do not, in fact
come off during the course of you date with my daughter, I will take my
electric nail gun and fasten your trousers securely in place to your
waist.

Rule Four:

I'm sure you've been told that in today's world, sex without
utilizing a "Barrier method" of some kind can kill you. Let me elaborate,
when it comes to sex, I am the barrier, and I will kill you.


Rule Five:

It is usually understood that in order for us to get to know
each other, we should talk about sports, politics, and other issues of
the day. Please do not do this. The only information I require from you
is an indication of when you expect to have my daughter safely back at my
house, and the only word I need from you on this subject is: early."

Rule Six:

I have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many opportunities
to date other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my
daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out with my little girl, you will
continue to date no one but her until she is finished with you. If you
make her cry, I will make you cry.

Rule Seven:

As you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my daughter to
appear, and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you
want to be on time for the movie, you should not be dating. My daughter
is putting on her makeup, a process than can take longer than painting
the Golden Gate Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why don't you do
something useful, like changing the oil in my car?

Rule Eight:

The following places are not appropriate for a date with my
daughter: Places where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a
wooden stool. Places where there is darkness. Places where there is
dancing, holding hands, or happiness. Places where the ambient
temperature is warm enough to introduce my daughter to wear shorts, tank
tops, midriff T-shirts, or anything other than overalls, a sweater, and a
goose down parka — zipped up to her throat. Movies with a strong
romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided; movies which features chain
saws are okay. Hockey games are okay. Old folks homes are better.

Rule Nine:

Do not lie to me. I may appear to be a potbellied, balding,
middle-aged, dimwitted has-been. But on issues relating to my daughter,
I am the all-knowing, merciless God of your universe. If I ask you
where you are going and with whom, you have one chance to tell me the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I have a shotgun, a
shovel, and five acres behind the house. Do not trifle with me.

Rule Ten:

Be afraid. Be very afraid. It takes very little for me to
mistake the sound of your car in the driveway for a chopper coming in
over a rice paddy near Hanoi. When my Agent Orange starts acting up, the
voices in my head frequently tell me to clean the guns as I wait for you
to bring my daughter home. As soon as you pull into the driveways you
should exit the car with both hands in plain sight. Speak the perimeter
password, announce in a clear voice that you have brought my daughter
home safely and early, then return to your car — there is no need for
you to come inside. The camouflaged face at the window is mine.

Thank you

One morning Bobby's mother was cleaning his room, and she found an S&amp;M magazine under the bed. She was beside herself worrying and stressing trying to think of how to handle the situation.

Finally her husband came home from work and he asked her how her day was.

The mother told him about the magazine. Shaking, she asked him how they were going handle this situation.

Her husband sat there for awhile, sighed, and said, "Well, I guess spanking him is out of the question."

Two men waiting at the Pearly Gates strike up a conversation.

"How'd you die?" the first man asks the second.

"I froze to death," says the second.

"That's awful," says the first man.

"How does it feel to freeze to death?"

"It's very uncomfortable at first", says the second man. "You get the shakes, and you get pains in all your fingers and toes. But eventually, it's a very calm way to go. You get numb and you kind of drift off, as if you're sleeping.

How about you, how did you die?"

"I had a heart attack," says the first man. "You see, I knew my wife was cheating on me, so one day I showed up at home unexpectedly. I ran up to the bedroom, and found her alone, knitting. I ran down to the basement, but no one was hiding there, either. I ran up to the second floor, but no one was hiding there either. I ran as fast as I could to the attic, and just as I got there, I had a massive heart attack and died."

The second man shakes his head. "That's so ironic," he says.

"What do you mean?" asks the first man.

"If you had only stopped to look in the freezer, we'd both still be alive."

Two sisters, one blonde and one brunette, inherit the family ranch.
Unfortunately, after just a few years, they are in financial trouble. In
order to keep the bank from repossessing the ranch, they need to purchase a
bull so that they can breed their own stock. The brunette balances their
checkbook, then takes their last $600 dollars out west to another ranch where
a man has a prize bull for sale. Upon leaving, she tells her sister, "When I
get there, if I decide to buy the bull, I'll contact you to drive out after
me and haul it home."

The brunette arrives at the man's ranch, inspects the bull, and decides she
does want to buy it. The man tells her that he can sell it for $599, no less.
After paying him, she drives to the nearest town to send her sister a
telegram to tell her the news.

She walks into the telegraph office, and says, "I want to send a telegram to
my sister telling her that I've bought a bull for our ranch.

I need her to hitch the trailer to our pickup truck and drive out here so we
can haul it home."

The telegraph operator explains that he'll be glad to help her, then
adds,"It's just 99 cents a word." Well, after paying for the bull, the
brunette only has $1 left. She realizes that she'll only be able to send her
sister one word. After thinking for a few minutes, she nods, and says, "I
want you to send her the word, 'comfortable.'"

The telegraph operator shakes his head. "How is she ever going to know that
you want her to hitch the trailer to your pickup truck and drive out here to
haul that bull back to your ranch if you send her the word, 'comfortable?"?'"

The brunette explains, "My sister's a blonde. She'll read it slow."

Q: How many women with PMS does it take to change a light bulb?

A: One. Only ONE!! And do you know WHY it only takes ONE? Because no one else in this house knows HOW to change a light bulb. They don't even know the bulb is BURNED OUT. They would sit in this house in the dark for THREE DAYS before they figured it OUT. And once they figured it out they wouldn't be able to find the light bulbs despite the fact that they've been in the SAME CUPBOARD for the past SEVENTEEN YEARS. But if they did, by some miracle, actually find the light bulbs, TWO DAYS LATER the chair that they dragged from two rooms over to stand on to change the STUPID light bulb would STILL BE IN THE SAME SPOT!! AND UNDERNEATH IT WOULD BE THE CRUMPLED WRAPPER THE STUPID @*!#$% LIGHT BULBS CAME IN! WHY?! BECAUSE NO ONE IN THIS HOUSE EVER CARRIES OUT THE GARBAGE!! IT'S A WONDER WE HAVEN'T ALL SUFFOCATED FROM THE PILES OF GARBAGE THAT ARE 12 FEET DEEP THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE HOUSE. THE HOUSE!! IT WOULD TAKE AN ARMY TO CLEAN THIS … I'm sorry … what did you ask me?

The man was sitting watching the TV one day and his wife came into the room and bonked him on the head with a frying pan.

"ouch, what was that for?"

"what's this piece of paper in your trouser pocket that says "Marylou" on it and has a number on it?"

"Oh, that's the horse I bet on at the track last week"

His wife went away seemingly satisfied. A few days later he was engrossed in the newspaper and his wife gave him a really hard bonk with a bigger frying pan.

Hey, why did you do that?!!"

"The horse phoned!"

WOMEN

Women have strengths that amaze men. They carry children, they carry hardships, they carry burdens, but they hold happiness, love and joy. They smile when they want to scream. They sing when they want to cry. They cry when they are happy and laugh when they are nervous.

They volunteer for good causes. They are pink ladies in hospitals, they bring food to shut ins. They are child care workers, executives, attorneys, stay-at-home moms, biker babes and your neighbors.

They do without new shoes so their children can have them. They go to the doctor with a frightened friend. They love unconditionally.

Women are honest, loyal, and forgiving. They are smart, knowing that knowledge is power. But they still know how to use their softer side to make a point.

Women want to be the best for their family, their friends, and themselves.

A woman's touch can cure any ailment. They know that a hug and a kiss can heal a broken heart. She can make a romantic evening unforgettable.

The heart of a woman is what makes the world spin! They bring joy and hope. They give compassion and ideals. They give moral support to their family and friends.

And all they want back is a hug, a smile and for you to do the same to people you come in contact with.

MEN

Men are good at lifting heavy stuff.

Tower: "Eastern 702, cleared for takeoff, contact departure on 124.7"

Tower: "Continental 635, cleared for takeoff, contact departure on 124.7, did you copy the report from Eastern?"

Continental 635: Cleared for takeoff roger, and yes we copied Eastern and we've already notified our caterers."

Remember Marriage is the number one cause of divorce.

It's TRUE! Statistically 100% of all divorces started with marriage!

I married Miss Right. I just didn't know her first name was Always.

Marriage is a 3-ring circus: Engagement ring, wedding ring, and suffering.

The last fight was my fault. My wife asked, "What's on the TV?" I said, "Dust!"

In the beginning, God created earth and rested. Then God created man and rested. Then God created woman. Since then, neither God nor man has rested.

Why do men die before their wives? They want to.

A beggar walked up to a well dressed woman shopping on Rodeo Drive and said, "I haven't eaten anything in four days." She looked at him and said, "I wish I had your willpower."

Do you know the punishment for bigamy? Two mothers-in-law.

Young son: Is it true, Dad, I heard that in some parts of Africa a man doesn't know his wife until he marries her?
Dad: That happens in every country, son.

A man inserted an 'ad' in the classified: "Wife wanted". Next day he received a hundred letters. They all said the same thing: "You can have mine."

The most effective way to remember your wife's birthday is to forget it once.

First guy (proudly): "My wife's an angel!"
Second guy: "You're lucky, mine's still alive."

How do most men define marriage? An expensive way to get laundry done for free.

Just think, if it weren't for marriage, men would go through life thinking they had no faults at all!

If you want your wife to listen and pay undivided attention to every word you say, talk in your sleep.

Then there was a man who said, "I never knew what real happiness was until I got married; and then it was too late."

Mommy has told her little girl all about the making of babies. Little Annie is now silent for a while.

"You understand it now?" Mommy asks.

"In exactly the same way as with babies."

"Wow!" the girl exclaims. "My daddy can do ANYTHING!"

* When it appears that you have killed the monster, NEVER check to see if it's really dead.

* If you find that your house is built upon or near a cemetery, that was once a church that was used for black masses, had previous inhabitants who went mad or committed suicide or died in some horrible fashion, or had inhabitants who performed necrophilia or satanic practices, move away immediately.

* Never read a book of demon summoning aloud, even as a joke.

* Do not search the basement, especially if the power has just gone out.

* As a general rule, don't solve puzzles that open portals to Hell.

* If you find a town which looks deserted, it's probably for a reason. Take the hint and stay away.

* Don't fool with recombinant DNA technology unless you're sure you know what you are doing.

* If you're running from the monster, expect to trip or fall down at least twice, more if you are of the female persuasion. Also note that, despite the fact that you are running and the monster is merely shambling along, it's still moving fast enough to catch up with you.

* Do not keep all your sharpened kitchen knifes in one of those wooden block thingies on your worksurface.

* When you're searching a house because you think there's something dangerous there, for God's sake turn the bloody lights on!

* Never back out of one room into another without looking. It's always behind you.

* Never, ever, ever turn off the paved road onto a gravel or dirt road.

* Always make sure that your car has a fresh battery so it will start immediately in times of crisis.

* Never say that you'll be right back because you won't.

* If anything other than water (blood, thick goo of any color)comes out of a faucet, do not call a plumber. Leave the house immediately.

* If, looking in a mirror, you see a figure behind you that you don't see upon turning around, you see a different room than the one you are in, you see a figure other than yourself looking back, or your reflection tells you to get out before it is too late, proceed to the nearest exit with all speed.

* If you open a door and the room you see is not the room that should be there, do not explore it. In fact, even if you close the door and see the correct room after re-opening it, vacate the house.

* Above all, if you hear background music that is increasing to a frenzy, run like there is no tomorrow, because the unimaginable is about to happen!

The CIA had an opening for an assassin. After all of the background checks, interviews, and testing were done there were three finalists, two men and a woman. For the final test, the CIA agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. "We must know that you will follow your instructions, no matter what the circumstances. Inside of this room you will find your wife sitting in a chair, Kill her", The man said, "you can't be serious I could never shoot my wife." The agent said, "Then you're not the right man for this job,"

The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about five minutes. Then the man came out with tears in his eyes. "I tried, but I can't kill my wife."

The agent said, "You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go "home."

Finally, it was the woman's turn.

She was given the same instructions, to kill her husband. She took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one shot after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman.

She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, "You guys didn't tell me the gun was loaded with blanks, I had to beat him to death with the chair.

The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings, but shorter tempers; wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints.

We spend more, but have less; we buy more, but enjoy it less. We have bigger houses and smaller families; more conveniences, but less time;

We have more degrees, but less sense; more knowledge, but less judgment; more experts, but more problems; more medicine, but less wellness.

We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry too quickly, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too seldom, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values.

We talk too much,love too seldom, and hate too often.

We've learned how to make a living, but not a life; we've added years to life, not life to years.

We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet the new neighbor. We've conquered outer space, but not inner space. We've done larger things, but not better things.

We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We've split the atom, but not our prejudice.

We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less.

We've learned to rush, but not to wait. We build more computers to hold more information to produce more copies than ever, but have less communication.

These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion; tall men, and short character; steep profits, and shallow relationships.

These are the times of world peace, but domestic warfare; more leisure, but less fun; more kinds of food, but less nutrition.

These are days of two incomes, but more divorce; of fancier houses, but broken homes.

These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throw-away morality, one-night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer to quiet, to kill.

It is a time when there is much in the show window and nothing in the stockroom; a time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete.

A small boy is sent to bed by his father. Five minutes later: "Da-ad …"

"What?"

"I'm thirsty. Can you bring me a drink of water?"

"No. You had your chance. Lights out."

Five minutes later: "Da-aaaad…"

"WHAT?" "I'm THIRSTY … Can I have a drink of water??"

"I told you NO! If you ask again I'll have to spank you!!"

Five minutes later: "Daaaa-aaaad…"

"WHAT??!!"

"When you come in to spank me, can you bring me a drink of water?"


******************************************************************
An exasperated mother, whose son was always getting into mischief, finally asked him, "How do you expect to get into Heaven?" The boy thought it over and said, "Well, I'll just run in and out and in and out and keep slamming the door until St. Peter says, 'For Heaven's sake, Jimmy, come in or stay out!'"



******************************************************************
One summer evening during a violent thunderstorm a mother was tucking her small boy into bed. She was about to turn off the light when he asked with a tremor in his voice, "Mommy, will you sleep with me tonight?" The mother smiled and gave him a reassuring hug. "I can't, dear," she said. "I have to sleep in Daddy's room." A long silence was broken at last by his shaky little voice: "The big sissy."



******************************************************************

A mother took her three-year-old daughter to church for the first time The church lights were lowered, and then the choir came down the aisle, carrying lighted candles. All was quiet until the little one started to sing in a loud voice, "Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you …"



******************************************************************

Nine-year-old Joey was asked by his mother what he had learned in Sunday School. "Well, Mom, our teacher told us how God sent Moses behind enemy lines on a rescue mission to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. When he got to the Red Sea, he had his engineers build a pontoon bridge, and all the people walked across safely. He used his walkie-talkie to radio headquarters and call in an air strike. They sent in bombers to blow up the bridge and all the Israelites were saved." "Now, Joey, is that REALLY what your teacher taught you?" his mother asked. "Well, no, Mom, but if I told it the way the teacher did, you'd never believe it!"



******************************************************************
It was that time during the Sunday morning service for "the children's sermon," and all the children were invited to come forward. One little girl was wearing a particularly pretty dress and, as she sat down, the pastor leaned over and said to her, "That is a very pretty dress. Is it your Easter dress?" The little girl replied, directly into the pastor's clip-on microphone, "Yes, and my Mom says it's hell to iron."


****************************************************************
Finding one of her students making faces at others on the playground, Ms. Smith stopped to gently reprove the child. Smiling sweetly, the Sunday School teacher said, "Bobby, when I was a child I was told if I made ugly faces, it would freeze and I would stay like that." Bobby looked up and replied, "Well, Ms Smith, you can't say you weren't warned."

2.) 4.9 cm3 NaHCO3
3.) 4.9 cm3 refined halite
4.) 236.6 cm3 partially hydrogenated tallow triglyceride
5.) 177.45 cm3 crystalline C12H22O11
6.) 177.45 cm3 unrefined C12H22O11
7.) 4.9 cm3 methyl ether of protocatechuic aldehyde
8.) Two calcium carbonate-encapsulated avian
albumen-coated protein
9.) 473.2 cm3 theobroma cacao
10.) 236.6 cm3 de-encapsulated legume meats (sieve size #10)

To a 2-L jacketed round reactor vessel (reactor #1)
with an overall heat transfer coefficient of about
100 Btu/F-ft2-hr, add ingredients one, two and three
with constant agitation.

In a second 2-L reactor vessel with a radial flow
impeller operating at 100 rpm, add ingredients four,
five, six, and seven until the mixture is homogenous.

To reactor #2, add ingredient eight, followed by three
equal volumes of the homogenous mixture in reactor #1.
Additionally, add ingredient nine and ten slowly, with
constant agitation. Care must be taken at this point in
the reaction to control any temperature rise that may be
the result of an exothermic reaction.

Using a screw extrude attached to a #4 nodulizer, place
the mixture piece-meal on a 316SS sheet (300 x 600 mm).
Heat in a 460K oven for a period of time that is in
agreement with Frank and Johnston's first order rate
expression (see JACOS, 21, 55), or until golden brown.
Once the reaction is complete, place the sheet on a 25C
heat-transfer table, allowing the product to come to equilibrium.

I have found at my age going bra-less pulls all the wrinkles out of my face.

You're getting old when you don't care where your spouse goes, just as long as you don't have to go along.

Statistics show that at the age of seventy, there are five women to every man. Isn't that an ironic time for a guy to get those odds?

Middle age is when it takes longer to rest than to get tired.

By the time a man is wise enough to watch his step, he's too old to go anywhere.

Middle age is when you have stopped growing at both ends, and have begun to grow in the middle.

Someone has described heaven as a family reunion that never ends. What Could hell possibly be like? Home videos of the same reunion?

A man has reached middle age when he is cautioned to slow down by his Doctor instead of by the police.

Middle age is having a choice of two temptations and choosing the one that will get you home earlier.

You know you're into middle age when you realize that caution is the only thing you care to exercise.

At my age, "getting a little action" means I don't need to take a laxative.

Don't worry about avoiding temptation. As you grow older, it will avoid you.

The aging process could be slowed down if it had to work its way through Congress.

You're getting old when "getting lucky" means you find your car in the parking lot.

You're getting old when your wife gives up sex for Lent, and you don't know till the 4th of July.

You're getting old when you wake up with that morning-after feeling, and didn't do anything the night before.

Imagine the conversation The Creator might have had with St. Francis on the subject of lawns:

GOD: Frank, you know all about gardens and nature. What in the world is going on down there in the Midwest? What happened to the dandelions, violets, thistle and stuff I started eons ago? I had a perfect, no-maintenance garden plan. Those plants grow in any type of soil, withstand drought and multiply with abandon. The nectar from the long lasting blossoms attracts butterflies, honey bees and flocks of songbirds. I expected to see a vast garden of colors by now. But all I see are these green rectangles.

ST. FRANCIS: It's the tribes that settled there, Lord. The Suburbanites. They started calling your flowers "weeds" and went to great lengths to kill them and replace them with grass.

GOD: Grass? But it's so boring. It's not colorful. It doesn't attract butterflies, birds and bees, only grubs and sod worms. It's temperamental with temperatures. Do these Suburbanites really want all that grass growing there?

ST. FRANCIS: Apparently so, Lord. The go to great pains to grow it and keep it green. The begin each spring by fert- ilizing grass and poisoning any other plant that crops up in the lawn.

GOD: The spring rains and warm weather probably make grass grow really fast. That must make the Suburbanites happy.

ST. FRANCIS: Apparently not, Lord. As soon as it grows a little, they cut it-sometimes twice a week.

GOD: They cut it? Do they then bail it like hay?

ST. FRANCIS: Not exactly, Lord. Most of them rake it up and put it in bags.

GOD: They bag it? Why? Is it a cash crop? Do they sell it?

ST. FRANCIS: No Sir. Just the opposite. They pay to throw it away.

GOD: Now let me get this straight. They fertilize grass so it will grow. And when it does grow, they cut it off and pay to throw it away?

ST. FRANCIS: Yes, Sir.

GOD: These Suburbanites must be relieved in the summer when we cut back on the rain and turn up the heat. That surely slows the growth and saves them a lot of work.

ST. FRANCIS: You aren't going to believe this Lord. When the grass stops growing so fast, they drag out hoses and pay more money to water it so they can continue to mow it and pay to get rid of it.

GOD: What nonsense. At least they kept some of the trees. That was a sheer stroke of genius, if I do say so myself. The trees grow leaves in the spring to provide beauty and shade in the summer. In the autumn they fall to the ground and form a natural blanket to keep moisture in the soil and protect the trees and bushes. Plus, as they rot, the leaves form compost to enhance the soil. It's a natural circle of life.

ST. FRANCIS: You better sit down, Lord. The Suburbanites have drawn a new circle. As soon as the leaves fall, they rake them into great piles and pay to have them hauled away.

GOD: No. What do they do to protect the shrub and tree roots in the winter and to keep the soil moist and loose?

ST. FRANCIS: After throwing away the leaves, they go out and buy something which they call mulch. The haul it home and spread it around in place of the leaves.

GOD: And where do they get this mulch?

ST. FRANCIS: They cut down trees and grind them up to make the mulch.

GOD: Enough. I don't want to think about this anymore. St. Catherine, you're in charge of the arts. What movie have you scheduled for us tonight?

ST. CATHERINE: Dumb and Dumber, Lord. It's a real stupid movie about …

GOD: Never mind, I think I just heard the whole story from St. Francis.

"Lawyers typically aren't funny — unless by accident. Case in point: The following questions from lawyers were taken from official court records nationwide …

Was that the same nose you broke as a child?

Now, doctor, isn't it true that when a person dies in his sleep, in most cases he just passes quietly away and doesn't know anything about it until the next morning?

Q: What happened then?

A: He told me, he says, "I have to kill you because you can identify me."

Q: Did he kill you?

Was it you or your brother that was killed in the war?

The youngest son, the 20-year-old, how old is he?

Were you alone or by yourself.

How long have you been a French Canadian?

Do you have any children or anything of that kind?

Q: I show you exhibit 3 and ask you if you recognize that picture.

A: That's me.

Q: Were you present when that picture was taken?

Were you present in court this morning when you were sworn in?

Q: Now, Mrs. Johnson, how was your first marriage terminated?
A: By death.
Q: And by whose death was it terminated?

Q: Do you know how far pregnant you are now?
A: I'll be three months on November 8.
Q: Apparently, then, the date of conception was August 8?
A: Yes.
Q: What were you doing at that time?

Q: Mrs. Jones, do you believe you are emotionally stable?
A: I used to be.
Q: How many times have you committed suicide?

So you were gone until you returned?

Q: She had three children, right?
A: Yes.
Q: How many were boys?
A: None.
Q: Were there girls?

You don't know what it was, and you didn't know what it
looked like, but can you describe it?

Q: You say that the stairs went down to the basement?
A: Yes.
Q: And these stairs, did they go up also?

Q: Have you lived in this town all your life?
A: Not yet.

A Texas attorney, realizing he was on the verge of
unleashing a stupid question, interrupted himself and
said, "Your Honor, I'd like to strike the next
question."

Q: Do you recall approximately the time that you
examined the body of Mr. Edington at the rose Chapel?
A: It was in the evening. The autopsy started about
8:30 p.m.
Q: And Mr. Edington was dead at the time, is that
correct?
A: No, you stupid, he was sitting on the table
wondering why I was doing an autopsy!

This 85 year old couple, having been married almost 60 years, had died in a car crash. They had been in good health the last ten years, mainly due to her interest in health food, and exercise.

When they reached the pearly gates, St. Peter took them to their mansion which was decked out with a beautiful kitchen and master bath suite and Jacuzzi. As they "oohed and aahed" the old man asked Peter how much all this was going to cost.

"It's free," Peter replied, "this is Heaven."

Next they went out back to see the championship golf course that the home backed up to. They would have golfing privileges everyday and each week the course changed to a new one representing the great golf courses on earth.

The old man asked, "What are the green fees?"

Peter's reply, "This is heaven, you play for free."

Next they went to the club house and saw the lavish buffet lunch with the cuisine's of the world laid out. "How much to eat?" asked the old man.

"Don't you understand yet? This is heaven, it is free!" Peter replied.

"Well, where are the low fat and low cholesterol foods?" the old man asked timidly.

"That's the best part … you can eat as much as you like of whatever you like and you never get fat and you never get sick. This is Heaven."

The old man looked at his wife and said, "You and your blasted bran muffins!! I could have been here ten years ago!"

A butcher is working, and really busy. He notices a dog in his shop and shoos him away. Later, he notices the dog is back again.

He walks over to the dog, and notices the dog has a note in his mouth. The butcher takes the note, and it reads, "Can I have 12 sausages and a leg of lamb, please."

The butcher looks, and lo and behold, in the dog's mouth there is a ten dollar bill. So the butcher takes the money, puts the sausages and lamb in a bag, and places it in the dog's mouth.

The butcher is very impressed, and since it's closing time, he decides to close up shop and follow the dog. So, off he goes.

The dog is walking down the street and comes to a crossing. The dog puts down the bag, jumps up and presses the crossing button. Then he waits patiently, bag in mouth, for the light to change. It does, and he walks across the road, with the butcher following.

The dog then comes to a bus stop, and starts looking at the timetable. The butcher is in awe at this stage. The dog checks out the times, and sits on one of the seats to wait for the bus.

Along comes a bus. The dog goes and looks at the number, notices it's the right bus, and climbs on. The butcher, by now openmouthed, follows him onto the bus.

The bus travels through town and out to the suburbs. Eventually the dog gets up, moves to the front of the bus, and standing on his hind legs, pushes the button to stop the bus. The dog gets off, groceries still in his mouth, and the butcher still following.

They walk down the road, and the dog approaches a house. He walks up the path, and drops the groceries on the step. Then he walks back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself — whap! — against the door. He goes back down the path, takes another run, and throws himself — whap! — against the door gain! There's no answer at the door, so the dog goes back down the path, jumps up on a narrow wall, and walks along the perimeter of the garden. He gets to a window, and bangs his head against it several times. He walks back, jumps off the wall, and waits at the door. The butcher watches as a big guy opens the door, and starts laying into the dog, really yelling at him.

The butcher runs up and stops the guy. "What the heck are you doing? This dog is a genius. He could be on TV, for God's sake!" To which the guy responds, "Clever, my eye. This is the second time this week he's forgotten his key."

Six Jewish gentlemen were playing poker in the condo clubhouse when Meyerowitz loses $500 on a single hand, clutches his chest and drops dead at the table. Showing respect for their fallen comrade, the other five complete their playing time standing up.

Finkelstein looks around and asks "Now, who is going to tell the wife?" They draw straws. Goldberg, who is always a loser picks the short one. They tell him to be discreet, be gentle, don't make a bad situation any worse than it is.

"Gentlemen! Discreet? I'm the most discreet mensch you will ever meet. Discretion is my middle name, leave it to me."

Goldberg schleps over to the Meyerowitz apartment, knocks on the door, the wife answers, asks what he wants.

Goldberg declares "Your husband just lost $500."

She hollers, "TELL HIM HE SHOULD DROP DEAD!"

Goldberg says, "I'll tell him."

In the mid 60s a U.S. Navy cruiser put in to port in Mississippi for a week's shore leave. The first evening, the Captain was more than a little surprised to receive the following letter from the wife of a local tycoon.

> Dear Captain,
>
> Thursday, will be my daughter Melinda's coming of age party. I would like you to send four well-mannered, handsome, unmarried officers. They should arrive at 8:00 p.m. prepared for an evening of polite Southern conversation and dance with our lovely young ladies. One last point: No Jews — We don't like Jews.

Sure enough, at 8:00 p.m. on Thursday, the lady heard a rap at the door, which she opened to find, in dress uniform, four exquisitely mannered, smiling African-American officers. Her lower jaw hit the floor, but pulling herself together she stammered, "There must be some mistake."

"Madam," said the first officer, "Captain Cohen doesn't make mistakes."

An Amish boy and his father were visiting a mall. They were amazed by almost everything they saw, but especially by two shiny, silver walls that could move apart and then slide back together again.

The boy asked, "What is this, Father?"

The father (never having seen an elevator) responded, "Son, I have never seen anything like this in my life, I don't know what it is."

While the boy and his father were watching with amazement, a fat old lady in a wheel chair rolled up to the moving walls and pressed a button. The walls opened and the lady rolled between them into a small room.

The walls closed and the boy and his father watched the small circular numbers above the walls light up sequentially. They continued to watch until it reached the last number and then the numbers began to light in the reverse order.

Finally the walls opened up again and a gorgeous, voluptuous 24 year old blonde woman stepped out.

The father, not taking his eyes off the young woman, said quietly to his son… "Go get your mother."

One day while driving with my then 4 year old daughter Melanie, I beeped
the horn by mistake.

She turned and looked at me for an explanation.

I said "I did that by accident".

She replied "I know that, daddy"

I replied, "How'd you know?"

Melanie said, "Because you didn't say 'JERK' afterwards!"

A preacher was making his rounds to his parishoners on a bicycle, when he came upon a little boy trying to sell a lawnmower.

"How much do you want for the mower?" asked the preacher.

"I'm just trying to make enough money to buy a bicycle," said the little boy.

After a moment of consideration, the preacher asked, "Will you take my bike in trade for it?"

The boy said, "You got a deal."

The preacher took the mower and tried to crank it. He pulled on the string a few times with no response from the mower.

The preacher called the little boy over and said, "I can't get this mower to start."

The little boy said, "That's 'cause you have to cuss at it to get it started."

The preacher said, "I'm a minister, and I can't cuss. It's been so long since I've been saved that I don't know if I even remember how to cuss."

The little boy looked at him happily and said, "Just keep pulling on that string. It'll come back to ya!"

A first grader was sitting in class as the teacher was reading the story of the Three Little Pigs. She came to the part of the story where the first pig was trying to acquire building materials for his home.

She said, "…And so the pig went up to the man with a wheelbarrow full of straw and said, 'Pardon me sir, but might I have some of that straw to build my house with?'"

Then the teacher asked the class, "And what do you think that man said?" and my friend's son raised his hand and said "I know! I know!, he said…'Holy shit! A talking pig!'"

The teacher was unable to teach for the next 10 minutes.

English: The Hostile Takeover
By HENRY BEARD

Rumors are rampant in the tiny, tight-knit world of dictionary compilers about what inside sources are calling "the deal of the century, no matter what century this actually is": the impending acquisition by a consortium of companies — including America Online Time Warner, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Yahoo and AT&amp;T — of the English language.

In recent days, word has spread among lexicographers that these computer and Internet giants have entered into an agreement with dictionary publishers and the cash-strapped British royal family, formal holders of the title to the Queen's English, to purchase exclusive worldwide rights to the venerable language and its offshoots, Baby Talk and Pidgin English.

According to a specialist in circumlocution at the Library of Congress, ordinary people would still be able to use English at no charge for casual conversations "conducted in person without artificial amplification." But communication in print or by telephone, fax, e-mail, broadcast media, walkie-talkie transmission or other "electronically enhanced modes" would be subject to a small monthly user fee charged directly to the "verbal subscriber" with the help of monitoring equipment already installed in most computer chips.

Although the full impact of the deal is impossible to assess before all the details are made public, a noted grammarian said he would certainly chafe under proposed provisions that would permit the new owners of English to restrict the use of derogatory words like "bug," "crash," or "malfunction," and retire objectionable terms like "monopoly," "fraud" or "censorship."

Several linguists made it clear that they find little to cheer about in what one of them described as "hollow reassurances" that people would still be free to communicate without restrictions by using hand signals, sign language or personal semaphore flags.

A prominent professor of philology, requesting anonymity, said she was profoundly concerned at reports that the new owners of English might seek to eliminate from the language certain "pejorative proprietary expressions" like "this is a Mickey Mouse outfit" or "it's another Edsel."

A thesaurus editor was troubled by suggestions that, in a form of linguistic product placement, about 1,000 new words like "Budlightly," "Chevytough," and "Metlifelike" would probably be added to the vocabulary in future versions of English, starting with the Idiom IV chip-compatible English 2001, which will be available sometime next year for $97.

"I would say that Shakespeare is rolling in his grave," the head of a prominent university publishing house remarked last week, "if it weren't for the fact that all references to any possible reactions by Shakespeare to current events have recently become the sole property of bardofavon.com."

Henry Beard is the author of "Computing: A Hacker's Lexicon."

She fell beneath the wheels and cried
She sent a hired thug to say
She freaked out on the lawn and screamed
I pushed her off the bridge and waved
But that's the way that pygmies say
She sealed me in the vault and smirked

Subject: GM Vs. Microsoft MICROSOFT SHOULD MAKE CARS, GM SHOULD MAKE SOFTWARE:

At a recent computer expo, Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto industry and stated: "If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving twenty-five dollar cars that got 1000 miles to the gallon."

In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release stating the following: "If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would be driving cars with the following characteristics: * For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice daily. * Every time they painted lines on the road, you would have to buy a new car. * Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason, and you would accept this, restart, and drive on. * Only one person at a time could use the car, unless you bought 'Car95' or 'CarNT' or 'Car2000,' then you would have to buy more seats. * Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was more reliable, five times as fast, twice as easy to drive, but would only run on five percent of the roads. * The oil, water, temperature, and alternator warning lights would be replaced by a single 'general car fault' warning light. * New seats would force everyone to have the same butt size. * The airbag system would ask "Are you sure?" before activating. * Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key, and grabbed hold of the radio antenna. * GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of Rand McNally road maps (now a GM subidiary), even though they neither need or want them. Attempting to remove this option would immediately degrade the cars' performance by fifty percent or more. * Every time GM introduced a new model, car buyers would be forced to learn how to drive all over again, because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old model. * You would have to press the 'Start' button to shut off the engine.

A small-town patrolman stopped a motorist for speeding and approached the driver. Peering into the back seat, he saw a large collection of knives, machetes, and swords. Thinking he had some wacko on his hands, the policeman placed a cautious hand on his firearm and asked the man to step out of the car. When queried about the contents of the back seat, the driver replied, "Oh, those! Officer, I'm a juggler and those are part of my act." Skeptical, the policeman thought he would call the man's bluff.

"If you can juggle these here machetes like you say, I'll let you off", the officer says. Well, sure enough, the driver IS a juggler, and his hands explode into a dizzying frenzy of spinning, twirling, flying blades, reflecting brilliantly in the afternoon sun! The blades fly behind his back, under his legs and over his head, in seamless fluid motion. He even tosses an apple into the fray and quarters it without missing a beat…

As this is occurring, a man driving by says to his wife, "Martha, it's a good thing I gave up drinkin'… look at the sobriety test they're giving now!"

1. Never raise your hands to your kids.
It leaves your groin unprotected.

2. I'm not into working out. My
philosophy: No pain, no pain.

3. I am in shape. Round's a shape…

4. I'm desperately trying to figure out
why kamikaze pilots wore helmets.

5. Ever wonder if illiterate people get
the full effect of alphabet soup?

6. I always wanted to be somebody,
but I should have been more specific.

7. Did you ever notice when you blow in a
dog's face he gets mad at you? But when
you take him in a car he sticks his head
out the window.

8. Have you ever noticed? Anybody going
slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going
faster than you is a maniac.

9. You have to stay in shape. My grandmother
started walking five miles a day when she was 60.
She's 97 today and we have no idea where she is.

10. I have six locks on my door all in a row. When
I go out, I lock every other one. I figure no matter
how long somebody stands there picking the
locks, they are always locking three.

11. The statistics on sanity are that one out of
every four Americans is suffering from some
form of mental illness. Think of your three best
friends. If they are okay, then it's you.

12. I ask people why they have deer heads on
their walls. They always say because it's such a
beautiful animal. There you go. I think my mother
is attractive, but I only have photographs of her.

13. A lady came up to me on the street and
pointed at my suede jacket. "You know a cow
was murdered for that jacket?" she sneered. I
replied in a psychotic tone, "I didn't know there
were any witnesses. Now I'll have to kill you too."

Ode To A Mammogram
(a.k.a. The Big Squeeze)

For years 'n years they told me,
"Be careful of your breasts.
Don't ever squeeze or bruise them,
And give them monthly tests."

So I heeded all their warnings
And protected them by law.
Guarded them very carefully,
An always wore a bra.

After thirty years of careful care,
The doctor found a lump,
He ordered up a Mammogram
To look inside that clump.

"Stand up very close," she said,
As she got my tit in line,
"And tell me when it hurts," she said,
"Ah, yes! There! That's just fine."

She stepped upon a pedal…
I could not believe my eyes!
A plastic plate was pressing down.
My boob was in a vise!!!

My skin was stretched 'n stretched
From way up by my chin,
And my poor tit was being squeezed
To Swedish pancake thin!!!

Excruciating pain I felt,
Within its viselike grip,
A prisoner in this vicious thing,
My poor defenseless tit!!

"Take a deep breath" she said to me
Who does she think she's kidding?
My chest is smashed in her machine,
I can't breathe and woozy I am getting.

"There, that was good," I heard her say
As the room was slowly swaying.
"Now let's get the other one."
"Lord, have mercy," I was praying.

It squeezed me from the up and down,
It squeezed me from both sides,
I'll bet she's never had this done
To her tender little hide!

If I had no problem when I came in,
I surely have one now…
If there had been a cyst in there,
It would have popped, Ker-pow!!

This machine was made by a man,
Of this I have no doubt.
I'd like to get his balls in there,
For months, he'd go "without"!!

Now, for another non-urban legend, have I told you about the visiting Japanese police chiefs delegation when my wife was translating for then-Mayor Neil Goldschmidt?

…it is necessary to recognize that the Japanese have neither the upside-down e sound, like the u in funny, nor the sharp a sound like the a in Fanny. Both are represented by the broad a sound of the a in father.

Neil Goldschmidt, then mayor of Portland, later Carter's Secretary of Transportation, later Governor of Oregon, speaks very fast, a real machine-gun style of delivery. Most foreign language interpreters have great difficulty staying up with him. When he was mayor, therefore, City Hall often called upon my wife, who has a fast ear, for Japanese-English translations for and English-Japenese translations of Hizzoner; she did other translations for the City as well.

Some Japanese chiefs of police were on an American tour, and the group was visiting Portland. After some discussions and formal presentations and show and tell by the Portland police bureau, the floor was open for questions from the Japanese.

"How do you handle bombs?" one of the Japanese chiefs of police asked, eschewing translation to use his hard-learned English.

The police spokesman explained that the bureau has a specially trained squad to handle such situations. When one is reported, the squad goes to the scene with a special truck, made stronger with concrete reinforcement, picks up the bomb, and takes it out to an unpopulated area on the outskirts of town, where it is blown up.

The Japanese were amazed. In Japanese, they exclaimed, "Kibisii!" (Tough!)

Then one in Japanese asked my wife to clarify: is that _really_ how they handle "bums"?

OTTAWA (CP) — An on-air prank by This Hour Has 22 Minutes, CBC-TV's satirical sketch series, at the expense of U.S. presidential candidate George W. Bush has drawn tremendous response from the show's viewers, says producer Geoff D'Eon. D'Eon says he has also received "a deluge of calls" from U.S. media, but there has been no official response from the Bush campaign.

This week's 22 Minutes aired a video clip showing comic Rick Mercer buttonholing the Texas governor during the recent Michigan primary.

Holding a microphone with a 22 Minutes flash, Mercer told Bush that "Canadian Prime Minister Jean Poutine" had endorsed the Republican presidential hopeful "as the man to lead the free world into the 21st century."

Bush said he was "honoured" to receive the support of Canada's prime minister, never realizing the surname given to him by Mercer was made up. After a rally outside a meeting hall in Canton, Mich., attended by about 300 Republicans, Mercer asked Bush to comment on "Prime Minister Poutine's" endorsement.

"I appreciate his strong statement, he understands I believe in free trade," Bush said seriously. "He understands I want to make sure our relations with our most important neighbour to the north of us, the Canadians, is strong and we'll work closely together." D'Eon says no one on Bush's staff pointed out that the Canadian prime minister's name was incorrect.

"Nobody blinked or batted an eyelid over the Poutine thing," D'Eon says. "The fact is they really don't know much about Canada."

The Prime Minister's Office treated Bush's gaffe with humour, adding "Clearly, Canada is not in the Bush leagues."

What is this show? And what is poutine anyway?

Poutine, of course, is a popular but calorie-rich Quebec fast-food concoction consisting of french fries, gravy and cheese curds.

Bush's knowledge of world leaders was severely tested last year when he failed to give the names of the leaders of Pakistan, India, Taiwan and Chechnya when asked by a Boston TV reporter. In other instances, Bush has confused foreign names and places and has referred to Greeks as "Grecians" and Kosovars as "Kosovarians."

With his in-the-field "reports" Mercer regularly pokes fun at Americans and their lack of knowledge of Canadian political affairs.

"We've done a lot of these segments and we're consistently flabbergasted at the outrageous things we can tell Americans about Canada and not get quizzed on," D'Eon says.

D'Eon agrees it's unlikely Mercer will be able to pull another such stunt, since the U.S. campaigners are now probably on the lookout. He also dismisses any suggestion that the prank might have influenced Bush's chances in the presidential race. "Absolutely not. That's ridiculous. We know from experience that Americans don't really care what we say or think up here. I mean, that's the point of this piece."

After an overnight flight to meet my father at his latest military assignment, my mother wearily arrived at Rhein-Main Air Base in Germany with my eight siblings and me — all under age 11.

Collecting our many suitcases, the ten of us entered the cramped customs area. A young customs official watched our entourage in disbelief. "Ma'am," he said, "do all these children and this luggage belong to you?"

"Yes, sir," my mother said with a sigh. "They're all mine."

The customs agent began his interrogation: "Ma'am, do you have any weapons, contraband or illegal drugs in your possession?"

"Sir," she calmly answered, "if I'd had any of those items, I would have used them by now."

The official allowed us to pass without opening a single suitcase.

A very elderly French couple was having an elegant dinner to celebrate their 75th wedding anniversary.

The old man leaned forward and said softly to his wife, "Dear, there is something that I must ask you. It has always bothered me that our tenth child never quite looked like the rest of our children. Now, I want to assure you that these 75 years have been the most wonderful experience I could have ever hoped for, and your answer can not take that all that away. But I must know, did he have a different father?"

The wife dropped her head, unable to look her husband in the eye. She paused for moment and then confessed sadly: "Yes. Yes, he did."

The old man was very shaken. The reality of what his wife was admitting hit him harder than he had expected. With a tear in his eye, the husband asked, "Who?… Who was he? Who was the father?"

Again the old woman dropped her head, saying nothing at first as she tried to muster the courage to tell the truth to her husband. Then, finally, she admitted, "You."

In a large Florida city, the local rabbi developed quite a reputation for his sermons; so much so that everyone in the community came every Shabbos.

Unfortunately, one weekend a member had to visit Long Island for his nephew's Bar Mitzvah, but he didn't want to miss the Rabbi's sermon. He decided to hire a "Shabbos goy"* to sit in the congregation and tape the sermon so he could listen to it when he returned.

Other congregants saw what was going on, and they also decided to hire "Shabbos goys" to tape the sermon so they could play golf instead of going to shul [temple]. Within a few weeks there were 500 gentiles sitting in shul taping the Rabbi.

The following Shabbos, the Rabbi, too, hired a Shabbos goy who brought a tape recorder to play his prerecorded sermon.

Witnesses said this marked the first incidence in history of artificial insermonation.

* Shabbos goy [Sabbath gentile] — a gentile who performs tasks forbidden to observant Jews on the Sabbath, such as turning lights on and off.

The following have been selected from lists of answers from 16-year-olds, compiled by the 1998 GCSE* examiners (believe it or not)

1. Ancient Egypt was inhabited by mummies and they all wrote in
hydraulics. They lived in the Sarah Dessert and traveled by Camelot.
The climate of the Sarah is such that the inhabitants have to live
elsewhere.

2. The Bible is full of interesting caricatures In the first book of
the Bible, Guinessis, Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree.
One of their children, Cain, asked, "Am I my brother's son?"

3. Moses led the Hebrew slaves to the Red Sea, where they made
Unleavened bread which is bread made without any ingredients. Moses
went up on Mount Cyanide to get the ten commandments. He died before
he ever reached Canada.

4. Solomon had three hundred wives and seven hundred porcupines.

5. The Greeks were a highly sculptured people, and without them we
wouldn't have history. The Greeks also had myths. A myth is a female
moth.

6. Actually, Homer was not written by Homer but by another man of that name.

7. Socrates was a famous Greek teacher who went around giving people
advice. They killed him. Socrates died from an overdose of wedlock.
After his death, his career suffered a dramatic decline.

8. In the Olympic games, Greeks ran races, jumped, hurled the
biscuits, and threw the java.

9. Eventually, the Romans conquered the Greeks. History calls people

playing the fiddle to them.

12. Joan of Arc was burnt to a steak and was cannonized by Bernard
Shaw. Finally Magna Carta provided that no man should be hanged twice

of the futile ages was Chaucer, who wrote many poems and verses and
also wrote literature.

14. Another story was William Tell, who shot an arrow through an
apple while standing on his son's head.

15. Queen Elizabeth was the "Virgin Queen." As a queen she was a
success. When she exposed herself before her troops they all shouted
"hurrah."

16. It was an age of great inventions and discoveries. Gutenberg
invented removable type and the Bible. Another important invention
was the circulation of blood. Sir Walter Raleigh is a historical
figure because he invented cigarettes and started smoking. And Sir
Francis Drake circumcised the world with a 100 foot clipper.

17. The greatest writer of the Renaissance was William Shakespeare.
He was born in the year 1564, supposedly on his birthday. He never
made much money and is famous only because of his plays. He wrote
tragedies, comedies, and hysterectomies, all in Islamic pentameter.
Romeo and Juliet are an example of a heroic couplet. Romeo's last
wish was to be laid by Juliet.

18. Writing at the same time as Shakespeare was Miguel Cervantes. e
wrote Donkey Hote. The next great author was John Milton. Milton
wrote Paradise Lost. Then his wife died and he wrote Paradise
Regained.

19. During the Renaissance America began. Christopher Columbus was a
great navigator who discovered America while cursing about the
Atlantic. His ships were called the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Fe.

20. Later, the Pilgrims crossed the ocean, and this was called
Pilgrim's Progress. The winter of 1620 was a hard one for the
settlers. Many people died and many babies were born. Captain John
Smith was responsible for all this.

21. One of the causes of the Revolutionary War was the English put
tacks in their tea. Also, the colonists would send their parcels
through the post without stamps. Finally the colonists won the War
and no longer had to pay for taxis. Delegates from the original
states formed the Contented Congress. Thomas Jefferson, a Virgin, and
Benjamin Franklin were two singers of the Declaration of
Independence. Franklin discovered electricity by rubbing two cats
backwards and declared, "A horse divided against itself cannot
stand.". Franklin died in 1790 and is still dead.

22. Soon the Constitution of the United States was adopted to secure
domestic hostility. Under the constitution the people enjoyed the
right to keep bare arms.

23. Abraham Lincoln became America's greatest Precedent. Lincoln's
mother died in infancy, and he was born in a log cabin which he built
with his own hands. Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves by signing the
Emasculation Proclamation. On the night of April 14, Lincoln went to
the theater and got shot in his seat by one of the actors in a moving
picture show. They believed the assinator was John Wilkes Booth, a
supposedly insane actor. This ruined Booth's career.

24. Meanwhile in Europe, the enlightenment was a reasonable time.
Voltaire invented electricity and also wrote a book called Candy.

25. Gravity was invented by Issac Walton. It is chiefly noticeable in
the autumn when the apples are falling off the trees.

26. Johann Bach wrote a great many musical compositions and had a
large number of children. In between he practiced on an old spinster
which he kept up in his attic. Bach died from 1750 to the present.
Bach was the most famous composer in the world and so was Handel.
Handel was half German half Italian and half English. He was very
large.

27. Beethoven wrote music even though he was deaf. He was so deaf he
wrote loud music. He took long walks in the forest even when everyone
was calling for him. Beethoven expired in 1827 and later died for
this.

28. The French Revolution was accomplished before it happened and
catapulted into Napoleon. Napoleon wanted an heir to inherit his
power, but since Josephine was a baroness, she couldn't have any
children.

29. The sun never set on the British Empire because the British
Empire is in the East and the sun sets in the West.

30. Queen Victoria was the longest queen. She sat on a thorn for 63
years. She was a moral woman who practiced virtue. Her death was the
final event which ended her reign.

31. The nineteenth century was a time of a great many thoughts and
inventions. People stopped reproducing by hand and started
reproducing by machine. The invention of the steamboat caused a
network of rivers to spring up. Cyrus McCormick invented the
McCormick raper, which did the work of a hundred men.

32. Louis Pasteur discovered a cure for rabbis. Charles Darwin was a
naturalist who wrote the Organ of the Species. Madman Curie
discovered radio. And Karl Marx became one of the Marx brothers.

33. The First World War, caused by the assignation of the Arch-Duck
by an anahist, ushered in a new error in the anals of human history.

Little Harold was practicing the violin in the living room while his father was trying to read in the den. The family dog was lying in the den, and as the screeching sounds of little Harold's violin reached his ears, he began to howl loudly.

The father listened to the dog and the violin as long as he could. Then he jumped up, slammed his paper to the floor and yelled above the noise, "For Pete's sake, can't you play something the dog doesn't know?!"

What Children Say

A kindergarten teacher was observing her classroom of children while they drew. She would occasionally walk around to see each child's artwork. As she got to one little girl who was working diligently, she asked what the drawing was. The girl replied, "I'm drawing God." The teacher paused and said, "But no one knows what God looks like." Without missing a beat, or looking up from her drawing, the girl replied, "They will in a minute."

---

A Sunday school teacher was discussing the Ten Commandments with her five and six year olds. After explaining the commandment to "honor thy Father and thy mother," she asked, "Is there a commandment that teaches us how to treat our brothers and sisters?" Without missing a beat one little boy (the oldest of a family) answered, "Thou shall not kill."

---

An honest seven-year-old admitted calmly to her parents that Billy Brown had kissed her after class. "How did that happen?," "It wasn't easy," admitted the young lady, "but three girls helped me catch him."

---

One day a little girl was sitting and watching her mother do the dishes at the kitchen sink. She suddenly noticed that her mother has several strands of white hair sticking out in contrast on her brunette head. She looked at her mother and inquisitively asked, "Why are some of your hairs white, Mom?" Her mother replied, "Well, every time that you do something wrong and make me cry or unhappy, one of my hairs turns white." The little girl thought about this revelation for while and then said, "Momma, how come ALL of grandma's hairs are white?"

---

A three-year-old went with his dad to see a litter of kittens. On returning home, he breathlessly informed his mother that there were two boy kittens and two girl kittens. "How did you know?" his mother "Daddy picked them up and looked underneath," he replied. "I think it's printed on the bottom."

---

The children had all been photographed, and the teacher was trying to persuade them each to buy a copy of the group picture. "Just think how nice it will be to look at it when you are all grown up and say, 'There's Jennifer; she's a lawyer,' or 'That's Michael. He's a doctor.'" A small voice at the back of the room rang out, "And there's the teacher. She's dead."

---

A teacher was giving a lesson on the circulation of the blood. Trying to make the matter clearer, he said, "Now, boys, if I stood on my head, the blood, as you know, would run into it, and I would turn red in the face.""Yes, sir,"the boys said. "Then why is it that while I am standing upright in the ordinary position, the blood doesn't run into my feet?" A little fellow shouted, "Cause yer feet ain't empty."

---

For weeks, a six-year old lad kept telling his first-grade teacher about the baby brother or sister that was expected at his house. One day the mother allowed the boy to feel the movements of the unborn child. The six-year old was obviously impressed, but he made no comment. Furthermore, he stopped telling his teacher about the impending event. The teacher finally sat the boy on her lap and said, "Tommy, whatever has become of that baby brother or sister you were expecting at home?" Tommy burst into tears and confessed, "I think Mommy ate it!"

At a computer software course, the participants were given an awkward question to answer: "If you had just boarded an airliner and discovered that your team of programmers had been responsible for the flight control software, how many of you would disembark immediately?"

"With my team's software," he reasoned, "the plane would be unlikely to successfully taxi to the runway, let alone take off."

A woman gives birth to a baby. Afterwards, the doctor comes in and says, "I have to tell you something about your baby."

The woman sits up in bed and says, "What's wrong with my baby, Doctor? What's wrong???"

The doctor says, "Well, now, nothing's wrong, exactly, but your baby is a little bit different. Your baby is a hermaphrodite."

The woman says, "A hermaphrodite… what's that???"

The doctor says, "Well, it means your baby has the… er… features… of a male and a female."

The woman turns pale. She says, "Oh my god! You mean it has a penis… AND a brain?"

The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by investigators at a major U.S. research university. The element, tentatively named Administratium, has no protons or electrons and thus has an atomic number of 0. However, it does have 1 neutron, 125 assistant neutrons, 75 vice neutrons, and 111 assistant vice neutrons. This gives it an atomic mass of 312.

These 312 particles are held together by a force that involves the continuous exchange of meson-like particles called morons. It is also surrounded by vast quantities of lepton-like particles called peons.

Since it has no electrons, Administratium is inert. However, it can be detected chemically as it impedes every reaction it comes in contact with. According to the discoverers, a minute amount of Administratium causes one reaction to take over four days to complete when it would have normally occurred in less than one second.

Administratium has a normal half-life of approximately three years, at which time it does not decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which assistant neutrons, vice neutrons, and assistant vice neutrons exchange places.

In fact, an Administratium sample's mass actually INCREASES over time, since with each reorganization some of the morons inevitably become neutrons, forming new isotopes.

This characteristic of moron promotion leads some scientists to speculate that perhaps Administratium is spontaneously formed whenever morons reach a certain quantity in concentration. This hypothetical quantity is referred to as "critical morass."

The Song of the Endoscopist
(From "The Enemakado")

by Robert R. Pascal, MD
Department of Pathology
Emory University Hospital
Atlanta, GA

On the curve of the sigmoid mucosa there sat
A polyp, large polyp, dark polyp.
And I mused to myself, "Oh, my, look at that;
A polyp, great polyp, great polyp.
You're not hyperlastic. I can tell by your size
That you're villous or tubular, or otherwise
Something unusual has met my eyes."
Oh, polyp, great polyp, great polyp.

With a twist of my hand, I extended the snare
To the polyp, dark polyp, great polyp,
And nipped off the stalk with my usual flair,
Taking polyp, great polyp, great polyp.
To Pathology, the polyp I quickly referred,
And later that week, I went there and heard
That what I had pulled out was merely a turd.
Not a polyp, no polyp, no polyp.

Two elderly couples were enjoying friendly conversation when one of the men asked the other, "Fred, how was the memory clinic you went to last month?"

"Outstanding," Fred replied. "They taught us all the latest psychological techniques: visualization, association, etc. It was great."

"That's great! And what was the name of the clinic?"

Fred went blank. He thought and thought, but couldn't remember. Then a smile broke across his face and he asked, "What do you call that flower with the long stem and thorns?"

"You mean a rose?"

"Yes, that's it!"

He turned to his wife, "Rose, what was the name of that memory clinic?"

take him to NASDAQ.

The third one wrote "ebeg" on his cup. Both IBM and HP sent
vice-presidents to talk to him about a strategic alliance and offered
him free hardware and professional consulting while Larry Ellison
claimed on CNBC that ebeg uses 95% Oracle technology and i2 announced
begTradeMatrix a b2b industry portal to offer supply chain

1. A Passover Song
[Sung to the tune of "These are a few of my favorite things"]
Cleaning and cooking and so many dishes
Out with the hametz, no pasta, no knishes
Fish that's gefillted, horseradish that stings
These are a few of our Passover things.
Matzoh and karpas and chopped up haroset
Shankbones and Kiddish and Yiddish neuroses
Tante who kvetches and uncle who sings
These are a few of our Passover things.
Motzi and maror and trouble with Pharoahs
Famines and locusts and slaves with wheelbarrows
Matzoh balls floating and eggshell that cling
These are a few of our Passover things.
When the plagues strike
When the lice bite
When we're feeling sad
We simply remember our Passover things
And then we don't feel so bad.

2. There's No Seder Like our Seder
(sung to the tune of "There's no Business like Show business")
There's no seder like our seder,
There's no seder I know.
Everything about it is Halachic
nothing that the Torah won't allow.
Listen how we read the whole Haggadah
It's all in Hebrew
'Cause we know how.
There's no Seder like our seder,
We tell a tale that is swell:
Moses took the people out into the heat
They baked the matzoh
While on their feet
Now isn't that a story
That just can't be beat?
Let's go on with the show!

3. Take Us Out of Egypt
(sung to the tune of "Take me out to the ball game")
Take us out of Egypt
Free us from slavery
Bake us some matzoh in a haste
Don't worry 'bout flavor--
Give no thought to taste.
Oh it's rush, rush, rush, to the Red Sea
If we don't cross it's a shame.
For it's ten plagues,
Down and you're out
At the Pesach history game.

4. Take Me Out To The Seder
(To the tune of , of course, "Take Me Out to the Ballgame!")
Take me out to the Seder
Take me out with the crowd.
Feed me on matzah and chicken legs,
I don't care for the hard-boiled eggs.
And its root, root, root for Elijah
That he will soon reappear.
And let's hope, hope, hope that we'll meet
Once again next year!
Take me out to the Seder
Take me out with the crowd.
Read the Haggadah
And don't skip a word.
Please hold your talking,
We want to be heard.
And lets, root, root, root for the leader
That he will finish his spiel
So we can nosh, nosh, nosh and by-gosh
Let's eat the meal!!!

5. Elijah
(to the tune of "Maria")
Elijah!
I just saw the prophet Elijah.
And suddenly that name
Will never sound the same to me.
Elijah!
He came to our seder
Elijah!
He had his cup of wine,
But could not stay to dine
This year--
Elijah!
For your message all Jews are waiting:
That the time's come for peace
and not hating--
Elijah--
Next year we'll be waiting.
Elijah!

6. Les Miselijah
(to the tune of "Do you hear the people Sing" from Les Miserables)
Do you hear the doorbell ring,
And it's a little after ten?
It can only be Elijah
Come to take a sip again.
He is feeling pretty fine
But in his head a screw is loose.
So perhaps instead of wine
We should only give him juice.

7. Just a Tad of Charoset
(to the tune of "Just a spoon full of sugar")
Chorus:
Just a tad of charoset helps the bitter herbs go down,
The bitter herbs go down, the bitter herbs go down.
Just a tad of charoset helps the bitter herbs go down,
In the most disguising way.
Oh, back in Egypt long ago,
The Jews were slaves under Pharoah.
They sweat and toiled and labored
through the day.
So when we gather Pesach night,
We do what we think right.
Maror, we chew,
To feel what they went through.
Chorus
So after years of slavery
They saw no chance of being free.
Their suffering was the only life they knew.
But baby Moses grew up tall,
And said he'd save them all.
He did, and yet,
We swear we won't forget.
That….
Chorus
While the maror is being passed,
We all refill our water glass,
Preparing for the taste that turns us red.
Although maror seems full of minuses,
It sure does clear our sinuses.
But what's to do?
It's hard to be a Jew!!!
Chorus

8. Same time next year
(to the tune of "Makin' Whoopee")
Another Pesach, another year,
The family seder with near and dear… Our faces shining,
All thoughts of dining
Are put on hold now.
We hear four questions,
The answer given
Recalls the Jews from Egypt driven.
The chrain is bitter, (charoset's better!)
Please pass the matzoh.
Why is this evening different
From all the other nights?
This year the Jews all over
Are free to perform the rites.
A gorgeous dinner--who can deny it--
Won't make us thinner, to hell with diet!
It's such great cooking…
and no one's looking,
So just enjoy it.
Moving along at steady clip
Elijah enters, and takes a sip;
And then the singing with voices ringing
Our laughter mingling.
When singing about Chad Gad Ya.
Watch close or your place you'll lose,
For Echad Mi Yodea:
Which tune shall we use?
We pray next Pesach
We'll all be here.
It's a tradition…
Same time next year…
So fill it up now, the final cup now, Next year at ____________

9. The Ballad of the Four Sons
(to the tune of "Clementine")
Said the father to his children, "At the seder you will dine,
You will eat your fill of matzoh, you will drink four cups of wine."
Now this father had no daughters, but his sons they numbered four.
One was wise and one was wicked, one was simple and a bore.
And the fourth was sweet and winsome, he was young and he was small.
While his brothers asked the questions he could scarcely speak at all.
Said the wise one to his father, "Would you please explain the laws?
Of the customs of the seder, will you please explain the cause?"
And the father proudly answered, "As our fathers ate in speed,
Ate the paschal lamb 'ere midnight, and from slavery were freed."
So we follow their example, and 'ere midnight must complete
All the seder and we should not, after 12 remain to eat.
Then did sneer the son so wicked, "What does all this mean to you?"
And the father's voice was bitter, as his grief and anger grew.
"If you yourself don't consider, a son of Israel,
Then for you this has no meaning, you could be a slave as well."
Then the simple son said simply, "What is this," and quietly
The good father told his offspring, "We were freed from slavery."
But the youngest son was silent, for he could not ask at all.
His bright eyes were bright with wonder as his father told him all.
My dear children, heed the lesson and remember ever more
What the father told his children told his sons that numbered four.

10. The Ballad of Mo Amramson
(to "The Ballad of Jed Clampett")
Come and listen to a story 'bout a man named Mo,
His people they were slaves to the evil Pharoah,
Until one day he was lookin' at a bush,
And he heard the voice of God, though he wasn't a lush---
The LORD, that is,
I AM,
The Big G.
Next thing you know, Mo's talkin' to Pharoah,
Mo says, "God said you gotta let my people go!"
But the king says, "No, they always will be slaves to me!"
So God sent down ten big plagues on Pharoah's whole country---
Blood 'n frogs, that is,
Pestilence,
Special effects.
When the first borns died, Pharoah sent the Jews away,
They ran and ate some matzoh on that very happy day,
So now we have our Seder to commemorate that feat---
We drink some wine and talk a lot, we sing and also eat!
Matzoh, that is,
Maror too.
And good food.
Y'all come back now, y'hear!

11. Afikomen 'Round the Mountain
Chorus
Afikomen 'round the mountain when she comes …
(1) She'll be drinkin' Mogen David…
slurp, slurp
(2) She'll be burpin on charoses ….
burp, burp
(3) She'll be chewin' on a shank bone
chomp, chomp
(4) She'll be sleepin' off the matzos
snoring sound

12. Haggadah Wash that Man Right out of my Hair
Hagadah wash that man right out of my hair
Because he's full of chometz
but he doesn't care.
That it's a custom now to be rid of that snare,
I'll send him on his way.
Haggadah drink my wine and feel real free,
Haggadah eat charosez, matzah and tea,
Haggadah keep the seder, with joy and glee.
I really love that day!!
He doesn't like gefilte fish,
eat it up, eat it up.
He doesn't like the matzah dish
Heat it up, heat it up.
can't wait for him to change --
Hey buddy… (repeat 1st verse).

13. Morror
(Sung to the tune of "More")
Morror is the bitterness the world has known,
But in Canada we need not moan.
Morror were the ghettos of across the sea,
But here we habitate a land that's free.
Morror on the table, we are sure and
we're able to look forward to many
types of joy — oh boy-oi-oi-oi…
Morror is the bitter herb upon our plate,
And if we were sober we would palitate
Morror is the answer for the schnorer,
who is rich or poorer --
Why can't we love forever …Morror!

14. The Eight Nights of Passover:
(To the tune of 'The Twelve Days of Christmas')
On the last night of Passover my mother served to me
eight briskets roasting
seven eggs a boiling
six capons baking
five gefilte fish
four cups of wine
three pieces of matzah
two dipped herbs
and a matzo ball in chicken soup

15. Pharaoh doesn't Pay
(To the tune of "I've been Working on the Railroad")
We've been working on these buildings;
Pharaoh doesn't pay.
We've been doing what he tells us
Mixing straw with clay.
Can't you hear the master calling,
"Hurry up, make that brick!"
Can't you feel the master whip us
'Til we're feeling sick.
Oy vay, it's a mess,
A terrible distress,
Oy vay, it's a mess for Jews, us Jews.
Moshe's in the palace with Pharaoh,
Warning of all God's clout, clout, clout.
Moshe's in the palace with Pharaoh,
And God's gonna get us out!
We're singing … .
Fee, Fi, Fiddely eye oh,
Make our matzahs "to go" oh oh oh.
Fee, Fi, Fiddely eye oh,
Stick it to the ol' Pharaoh!

16. Moses Island
(Sung to the tune of Gilligan's Island)
Just recline right back and you'll hear a tale,
a tale of dreadful trip.
That started with ten awful plagues brought onto Egypt,
brought unto Egypt.
The boss he was a Jewish man raised as a Pharaohos son.
Then G-d he did come calling and soon the fun begun,
soon the fun begun.
More blood, such frogs, and all those bugs,
Pharaoh could just barely see.
The Jews were really scoring points and soon they would be free.
and soon they would be free.
They shlepped and shlepped for forty years across a desert land.
He went up to Mt Sinai and a party soon began,
a party soon began.
Moses, the Pharaoh too, Aaron and his wife.
Marianne the skipper too here
on the desert island.

Passover is approaching. At the seder table, every Jewish child will be retold the story of Moses and the Pharoah, and how God brought boils, locusts, hail and the other plagues onto the Egyptians.

Yet in spite of this overwhelming evidence of God's intentions, Pharoah refused to let the Jews go, until a tenth plague, the death of the first-born children was inflicted on every Egyptian home, passing over the Jewish homes. Only after this tragedy did the Pharoah relent and let the Jews leave slavery and Egypt to begin their journey to the promised land.

This has been known for generations. What has not been known is why the Pharoah, in the face of such overwhelming evidence would refuse to release the Jews ater the first nine plagues. It took eight years of research by Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, the renowned psychologist and nurse, to find the definitive answer.

Dr. Kubler-Ross spent those years studying the Dead Sea Scrolls before discovering the answer. And once found, it was obvious:

The Pharoah was still in de Nile.

WRONG SHUI (Pronounced "Rong Shoe Ee", originated by Master Eu Plon Ka)

A selection of wrong shui tenets from The Little Book Of Wrong Shui,
by Rohan Candappa, Ebury Press, 1999 ISBN 0091869765

Nice To See You
Attract visitors to your home by placing stereo, video and computer
equipment where they can be seen from the road.

Defend Your Sacred Spaces
The space directly in front of your home is sacred. It is here that
you should practise Wrong Shui's sister art of Ka Pa King. On no
account let anyone occupy this sacred space.

Use Your Loaf
If your toast always lands butter-side down, plan ahead. Butter the
other side instead.

Doors
Try to ensure that your front door is at the edge of your home.
Internal front doors are bad Wrong Shui.

A Bright Idea
If parts of your home are prone to darkness, a light, carefully
located, will solve the problem.

The Ups And Downs Of Stairs
Stairs going up are good Wrong Shui. In your home only have stairs going up.

Go With The Flow
Flowing water is good Wrong Shui. So when winter approaches, remove a
couple of tiles or slates from the roof of your home.

Spread A Little Warmth
Fridges are, as a rule, cold unwelcoming places. Resolve the problem
by always leaving the door slightly ajar.

Home Sweat Home
Condensation on windows is only the atmosphere of your home condensed
into its liquid essence. Collect it in Tupperware beakers and
sprinkle it anywhere you want to feel more homely.

"Hello, I've Just Moved In"
When moving into a new home, an old fridge or washing machine
positioned carefully by the path to your front door will help you to
meet your neighbours.

And finally, what we all need to know:

Wisdom Of The East
It is an indisputable fact that wisdom from the East is far wiser
than wisdom from the West. When speaking to a group of friends or
colleagues, stand in the east of the room and what you say will be
taken more seriously.

Reader David Burrows tells us "How To Deal with Telemarketers" It's long-- — but I laughed out loud at a couple of the items. Now, if I only have the courage to try some of these…

1. If they want to loan you money, tell them you just filed for bankruptcy and you could sure use some money.

2. If they start out with, "How are you today?" say, "I'm so glad you asked, because no one these days seems to care, and I have all these problems; my arthritis is acting up, my eyelashes are sore, my dog just died…"

3. If they say they're John Doe from XYZ Company, ask them to spell their name. Then ask them to spell the company name. Then ask them where it is located, how long it has been in business, how many people work there, how they got into this line of work, are they married?, kids?, etc. Continue asking them personal questions or questions about their company for as long as necessary.

4. This works great if you are male: Telemarketer: "Hi, my name is Judy and I'm with XYZ Company…" You: Wait for a second and with a real husky voice ask, "What are you wearing?"

5. Cry out in surprise,"Judy! Is that you? Oh my God! Judy, how have you been?" Hopefully, this will give Judy a few brief moments of terror as she tries to figure out where the hell she could know you from.

6. Say "No", over and over. Be sure to vary the sound of each one, and keep a rhythmic tempo, even as they are trying to speak. This is most fun if you can do it until they hang up.

7. If MCI calls trying to get you to sign up for the Family and Friends Plan, reply, in as SINISTER a voice as you can, "I don't have any friends… would you be my friend?"

8. If the company cleans rugs, respond: "Can you get out blood? Can you get out GOAT blood? How about HUMAN blood?

9. After the Telemarketer gives their spiel, ask him/her to marry you. When they get all flustered, tell them that you could not just give your credit card number to a complete stranger.

10. Tell the Telemarketer that you work for the same company; they often can't sell to employees.

11. Answer the phone. As soon as you realize it is a Telemarketer, set the receiver down, shout or scream, "Oh my God!!!" and then hang up.

12. Tell the Telemarketer you are busy at the moment and ask him/her if he/she will give you his/her HOME phone number so you can call him/her back. When the Telemarketer explains that telemarketers cannot give out their HOME numbers you say "I guess you don't want anyone bothering you at home, right?" The Telemarketer will agree and you say, "Me, either!" Hang up.

13. Ask them to repeat everything they say, several times.

14.Tell them it is dinner time, BUT ask if they would please hold. Put them on your speaker phone while you continue to eat at your leisure. Smack your food loudly and continue with your dinner conversation.

15. Tell the Telemarketer you are on "home incarceration" and ask if they could bring you some beer.

16. Ask them to fax the information to you, and make up a number.

17. Tell the Telemarketer, "Okay, I will listen to you. But I should probably tell you, I'm not wearing any clothes."

18. Insist that the caller is really your buddy Leon, playing a joke. "Come on Leon, cut it out! Seriously, Leon, how's your mom?"

19. Tell them you are hard of hearing and that they need to speak up… louder… louder…louder…

20. Tell them to talk VERY SLOWLY, because you want to write EVERY WORD down.

One day, in the Garden of Eden, Eve called out to God, "Lord, I have a problem!"

"What's the problem, Eve?"

"Lord, I know that you have created me and this beautiful garden and these wonderful animals including that comedic snake, but I am just not happy."

"Why is that, Eve?" came the reply from above.

"Lord, I am lonely. And sick to death of apples."

"Well, Eve, in that case, I have a solution. I shall create a man for you."

"What is a man, Lord?"

"A man is flawed creature, with many undesirable traits. He will lie, cheat, and be vainglorious; all in all, he will give you a hard time. But he will be bigger, faster, and will like to hunt and kill things. Since you've been complaining, I will create him in such a way to satisfy your, uh, physical needs. He won't be too smart, and will need your advice to think properly. He will be witless, and revel in childish things, like kicking a ball about."

"Sounds great," says Eve, with an ironically raised eyebrow. "What's the catch, Lord?"

"Well, you may have him on one condition…"

"What is that, Lord?"

"As I said, he'll be proud, arrogant, and self-admiring. So you'll have to let him believe that I made him first. You must remember and keep it as our little secret. Woman to woman!"

Sally decided to do something wild that she hadn't done before, so she set out to rent her first X-rated adult video.

She went to the video store, quickly selected an erotically titled video from the shelf, and then proceeded to pay the cashier.

She drove home, lit some candles, slipped into something comfortable, and put the tape into the VCR.

To her disappointment, there was nothing but static on the screen. So she called the video store to complain.

Sally said, "I just rented an adult movie from you and there's nothing on the tape but static."

The store clerk replied, "Sorry about that. We've had problems with some of those tapes. Which title did you rent?"

Sally replied, "It's called 'Head Cleaner'."

[From inside Microsoft]

GATES TO U.S.: 'BRING MY SOURCE CODE BACK!'

(Macworld Wire Services) REDMOND, Wash. — Protestors continued to clash with police in this sleepy Seattle suburb after a daring predawn raid in which armed federal agents stormed Microsoft headquarters and seized the source code for the Windows operating system.

The raid, ordered by Attorney General Janet Reno, came after months of contentious negotiations between the government and the software giant over antitrust allegations against Microsoft.

"We had tried to negotiate with the Microsoft family in good faith," Reno told reporters in Washington. "But their intransigent stand and refusal to propose a fair settlement left us with no choice but to act swiftly."

More than 150 armed federal agents descended upon Microsoft after first firing canisters of tear gas to disperse the crowd of denim-clad employees, Starbucks clerks and local grunge rockers who had formed a human chain around the Redmond campus. After securing the building, the agents found the Windows source code hiding in a closet, where an emotional Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer was clutching it to his chest.

The Windows source code was immediately flown to Washington, where it was reunited with Juan Miguel Gonzalez.

"At last, I have been reunited with my beloved Windows source code," Gonzalez said through an interpreter. "At last, we have closure in this long dispute."

But the dispute appears far from over. An angry Bill Gates tearfully denounced a photograph depicting a joyous reunion between the Windows source code and Gonzalez, with Gates charging that the photo had been doctored.

"Look at the interface in the photo," said Gates, Microsoft's founder and chief technology officer. "It clearly doesn't have the robust features offered in Windows 2000. The Windows in that photo looks to me like version 3.1."

Some reporters noted that the interface looked more like the GUI of an early Mac. "Whatever," Gates said, as he vanished through a secret trap door.

Protestors also vowed that the fight was far from over.

"This time the government has gone too far," said Ariel Mayfeather, a coffee shop employee and one of the many local residents who has rallied behind Microsoft. "I haven't felt this ashamed to be an American since the day I received my liberal arts degree."

Government officials, however, stood by the move.

"I did not give the order, but I was informed of what was going on," said President Clinton, as he left a New York fund-raiser on his way to a fund-raising dinner in Philadelphia. "And I support Attorney General Reno's decision, especially since it does not appear to have affected my job approval ratings."

Reno said she had no regrets about the raid. Her press conference then ended suddenly, as federal agents surrounded the assembled reporters.

"I'm tired of all your 'How's the weather up there?' cracks," Reno said, before vanishing through a secret trap door.

Meanwhile, in Havana, Cuban officials celebrated the news that the Windows source code would soon return to their island nation.

"Viva Windows! Viva la revolucion!" said Cuban President Fidel Castro. "Now we have an operating system as elegant and efficient as our system of government."

MONDEGREENS ARE MISHEARINGS of common phrases, prayers, song lyrics and whatnot. Why they are called "mondegreens" and not "roundjohns" or "sundaymonkeys" is explained at http://www.sfgate.com/columnists/carroll, a fine Web site in every way.

Every year I publish mondegreens collected in the past 12 months, which yields a spate of more mondegreens. I would plead with contributors to a) include your name and b) include the real phrase or lyric or whatever, no matter how obvious it may seem to you.

Many mondegreens are uttered by children and lovingly collected by parents. When Kerry Halligan was living in Seattle, the family frequently went on jaunts that took them through the Battery Street Tunnel. When her daughter Heather recognized the route, she would yell, "Here comes the tunnel, everybody hold your breasts."

Hank De Sutter knew a kid who returned from San Francisco with excited descriptions of "fisherman's dwarf." David Dulberg's called eucalyptus trees "coo coo lipstick trees." Hedi Gerkin once performed with the Distaff Singers; the son of one of the other singers, just before a performance, encouraged his mother with "Break an egg, Mom."

When Dave Morrow was a child, he sang the lovely Christmas carol "Atomic bomb, atomic bomb …" Who knew what a "tannenbaum" was, anyway?

Religion is the source of much childhood confusion. Larry Rowinsky tells this story: "Growing up in a half- Yiddish/half-English home environment, I often felt hampered by nagging doubts about my ability to communicate in any language. When I entered public school, I really discovered I knew nothing about nothing. Particularly at Christmas.

"I didn't know what 'a way in a manger' was — what way? But I sang carols with the other kids … and I was still singing when I got home: 'The little Lord Cheezits … the little Lord Cheezits.'

"'Shh,' said my mother. 'Don't say those words. God will punish you.'"

And thus a child learned that a snack cracker was a tool of oppression. It's the power of mondegreens.

OVERHEARD PHRASES ON radio and television are another lode of mondegreens. Rich Carlsen heard on KCBS: "Putnam Oldsmobile is opening its nudist play area." Barbara Bishop heard Greta Van Susteren on CNN say, "Good night from Bird in a Poof," a reasonably fey name for a show often called "Burden of Proof." Another reader heard those Volkswagen ads praising "Fahrvergnugen" as promising "four Fig Newtons," perhaps handed out by the little Lord Cheezits.

Buff Silvera heard a top-of-the-news teaser about prisoners in San Quentin suffering from "the Berkeley locusts." Alas: tuberculosis. Doug Stone could have sworn he heard a news story about the Chinese producing new trombones. Alas: neutron bombs.

Earlier this year, Nicholas Mitchell decided to listen to the State of the Union address: "My mind was beginning to wander, but I was suddenly jolted to attention when I heard Clinton refer to 'a cannibal for progress.' I later read the text online and realized I had heard the phrase 'accountable for progress.'"

SHEILA BRENNAN WONDERS about those "offbeat minutes" the cell phone companies are always offering her. When Jo Donegan was reading bureaucratic forms for a living, she remembers, listed under "occupation," one particularly interesting entry: "arrow space."

Frank McGrady's friend Ron Holmes always wondered why Americans get together on New Year's Eve to sing about "old Hank's eye." Kyle in San Francisco writes: "She told me they had fresh urban cheese muffins. I said OK, yes, whatever. I'm a city person. I can handle it. She pulled the muffin from a bin labeled 'Herb 'n' Cheese Muffin.'"

But by far the greatest concentration of mondegreens comes from popular song lyrics, rock 'n' roll favorites from all eras, and that's tomorrow's column.

One day, a kid says "Daddy, daddy, I want to learn to play the bass." So dad hooks him up with lessons.

The first day, the kid comes home and dad says, "What did you learn today, son?" "I learned the first four notes on the fourth string," says junior.

The second day, dad says, "What did you learn today?" The kid says, "I learned the first four notes on the third string."

The third day, "What did you learn today, son?" "The first four notes on the second string."

Fourth day, the kid is late, and later, and when he finally gets home, his dad says, "How was your lesson today?"

"I couldn't make it to the lesson today, dad. I had a gig."

A 6 year old boy was found floating in the Atlantic Ocean today after being set adrift from Israel on a giant matzoh.

The boy, Eliat Ginsburg, and his mother, set out from Israel in an attempt to reach the Jewish Homeland, Miami. They started out in a small boat, the S.S. Shaynapunim, which capsized when the American captain forgot that ocean waves near Israel go from right to left. Eliat's heroic mother quickly pieced together the matzoh-raft and put him on it, then drowned under the weight of her gold jewelry. Her last words to her son were reported to be "Don't marry a Shiksa. She'll eat your HEART out. (glug) (glug)."

Eliat was soon picked up by a passing Gefilte fishing boat, and taken to Miami, after a quick nosh, a nice piece cake, whatever. There, he was turned over to the custody of his closest relatives, his great uncle, L'Chaim Ginsburg, and his 21 year old female cousin, M'shugena Ginsburg. He moved into their home in a Retirement Community on a golf course.

Shortly thereafter, his father, Jacob Moses Ginsburg, who was still in Israel, was notified. He almost plotzed. He was taken to the Plotz Unit of a nearby hospital, where he was given a chicken soup capsule and released. He then demanded to come to the U.S. to bring his son back. Since it was Friday night, he walked to Miami.

However, Eliat's Miami relatives opposed the way he was being raised in Israel. They claimed that in Israel, he had no freedom, no rights, no tennis lessons. Neighbors gathered around the Miami relatives' house to prevent the authorities for taking him away. They held up signs that read "Stay away! Every one of our sons are lawyers, and they're single too, if you know a nice girl." Meanwhile, they plied the boy with gifts to show him how wonderful it was in America. He was given a video game which was promptly taken away because it could "take an eye out." He was then given a dreydl and played "Find the Afikomen" with his little cousins.

When the father arrived in Miami, he was greeted by federal officials who warned him not to go to the Miami house, because it was dangerous. He responded, "What danger? There's no danger in Miami!"

The Jewish media pounced on this story with all it's power. Headlines read "LITTLE BOY PLAYS OUTSIDE WITHOUT A SWEATER." Talk shows posed questions like: "What's more important, parenthood or politics?" "What if an American boy was held in Israel?" "Where can you get a nice sandwich in Miami?" "Guess how much I paid for this?" It was ugly.

The boy's cousin, M'Shugena, became his primary caretaker, because she had no job, no kids, no husband and no skills. The situation took a toll on her. Neiman Marcus and Loehmans's called to see why she hadn't been in. Unbeknownst to her, the federal government was planning a secret rescue operation, known as "Operation Circumcise", to remove the boy from the house and cut him off from his family. Just then, it happened. To get into the area unnoticed, they arrived in a van cleverly disguised to look like a Chinese food delivery truck, and stormed the house. Neighbors came running like a vance when they heard the code word "treyf". Hundreds of neighbors poured into the house in an attempt to prevent the boy from being taken, but they were slowed down by their need to kiss the mezuzah each time they entered. But a trap was set for the agents. To slow them down, M'Shugena had poured slippery chicken fat all over the floor. But the neighbors, armed only with menorahs, were no match for the agents and their weapons. The boy was taken to the waiting van, which would speed off to re-unite him with his waiting father, after making a few more deliveries.

A couple had been married for 25 years and also celebrated their 60th birthdays. During the celebration a fairy appeared and said that because they had been such a loving couple all those years, she would give them one wish each.

The wife wanted to travel around the world. The fairy waved her wand and boom! She had the tickets in her hand.

Next, it was the husband's turn. He paused for a moment, then said shyly, "Well, I'd like to have a woman 30 years younger than me."

The fairy picked up her wand and boom! He was 90.

HAL MEGGISON ALWAYS wondered why Paul Simon was singing, "She's got diamonds on the sofa machine," and was not comforted to learn that she's actually got diamonds on the soles of her shoes. Helen Garvey heard a 3-year-old child singing, "Who is the daddy of the angel Aquarius?" and it's a good question.

Jennifer Cavalli's friend heard Pearl Jam sing "She can't find a pyramid," although "Better Man" is the name of the song. And Tama Blough somehow thought the balladeer was longing for "someone to walk over me," which was a little too pre-feminist for her tastes.

Erica Kelly heard Steve Winwood sing "bring me a higher love" as "bring me an iron lung," an equally poignant sentiment.

And then there's Anne, who failed to give her last name in her fine e-mail communication, who thought that the chorus of "Tubthumping" was "I've got no down, but I've got overhead," making it a rousing ditty about a heavily leveraged mortgage banker (actual lyric: "I get knocked down, but I get up again.").

She also believed that TAFKAPrince wanted "your estrogen and your kiss" (actually: "extra time"), while her husband went around singing "Werewolves and Thunder" (actually: "Werewolves of London.") What a zany family!

An entirely anonymous e-mailer wrote: "While I was riding in the car with my father in 1975, he asked in bewilderment, as Van McCoy's disco-era anthem boomed from the tinny car radio, 'Why do they keep saying, "Tuna hot dog?"' The correct phrase, of course, is 'Do the hustle,' but I still hear it the other way."

BEWILDERINGLY, DIANA ROSE heard Hank Williams Jr. sing, "I've got on the clothes I'm wearing," which was like, duh, only later learned it was "I don't own the clothes I'm wearing," which was only marginally more sensible.

Alexander van Broek heard Paul Simon sing "Mama don't take my clothes and throw 'em away," while Jan Nickum's son heard the same lyric as "Mama don't take my chromosomes away," which is closer to "don't take my Kodachrome away," which the singer enjoys because of its nice bright colors, its greens of summer, etc.

Donna Blow heard Elvis sing, "Wise men say, only fools love ships," which is an odd thing for wise men to say. Actually: "Fools rush in."

ANDREA FRANK'S CHUM Sean Rozell heard the Police sing, "When the world is running down, you make the best homemade stew around," which is very homey, although not "you make the best of what's still around."

By contrast, Chris Johnk heard the Police line "We are spirits in the material world" as "We are Cheerios in the bowl upstairs." By further contrast, Velva Hampton heard those very same Police sing, "You live your life like a canary in a coma."

Michael Dorman's wife heard the Red Hot Chili Peppers sing, "With the bourbon I'll share this lonely view," which is actually more decadent than the real "with the birds I'll share this lonely view."

Jim Ayres was convinced that the Jefferson Airplane sang, "When the turkey's found to be lies" (some anti-Thanksgiving reference, perhaps) and was disappointed by "When the truth is found to be lies." Similarly, Meg Rosenfield still prefers the JA's Summer-of-Lovish "And when she speaks, the whole world blesses the grass" to "when she speaks, oh what a pleasant surprise!"

Daniel Bernstein heard "Mighty square faces going ticktock to love" from "Addicted to Love." David Phillips commemorates the death of Hoyt Axton with "Joy to the world, all the boys and girls, joy to officials in the deep blue sea." Fishes! Creighton Bell heard Eric Clapton's "living on Tulsa time" as "living on toast and wine," which is Claptonesque indeed.

Finally: Jenny Sill-Holeman heard her husband singing the basketball player's lament: "Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm 6 feet 4?"

Moishe and Shmuel had not seen each other in many years. Now they had a long talk trying to fill in the gap of those years by telling about their lives.

Finally, Moishe invited Shmuel to visit him in his new apartment. "I got a wife and three kids and I'd love to have you visit us."

"Great. Where do you live?"

"Here's the address. And there's plenty of parking behind the apartment. Park and come around to the front door, kick it open with your foot, go to the elevator and press the button with your left elbow, then enter. When you reach the sixth floor, go down the hall until you see my name on the door. Then press the doorbell with your right elbow and I'll let you in."

"Good. But tell me… what is all this business of kicking the front door open, then pressing elevator buttons with my right, then my left elbow?"

"What, you're coming empty-handed?"

Two widows in Miami Beach are talking.

"That nice fellow Morris asked me out for a date. I know you went out with him last week, and I wanted to talk with you about him before an answer I give him."

"Well," the other widow says, "I'll tell you. When I went on my date with him, he shows up at my apartment punctual like a clock. And like such a mensch he is dressed. Fine suit, wonderful lining. And he brings me such beautiful flowers, you could die from. Then he takes me downstairs, and what's there but such a beautiful car … a limousine even, uniformed chauffeur and all. Then he takes me out for a dinner, a marvelous dinner. Kosher even. Then we go see a show. Let me tell you, I enjoyed it so much I could just plotz. So then we are coming back to my apartment, and into an ANIMAL he turns. Completely crazy, he tears off my expensive new dress and has his way with me!"

"Oy vey," the first widow responds, "So you are telling me I shouldn't go out with him?"

"No, I'm just saying that if you go, wear a shmateh." [a rag]

A bear walked into a bar in Billings, Montana and sat down. He banged on the bar with his paw demanding a beer. The bartender approached saying, "We don't serve beer to bears in bars in Billings."

Becoming angry, the bear again demanded that he be served. This only served to bring the bartender to tell him more forcefully, "We don't serve beer to belligerent bears in bars in Billings."

Now in full blown rage, the bear roared, "If you don't serve me a beer, I'm going to eat that lady sitting at the end of the bar." To this, the bartender merely replied, "Sorry, we don't serve beer to belligerent, bullying bears in bars in Billings."

The bear then went to the end of the bar and true to his word, ate the woman. That done he went back to his seat and once again demanded a beer. Unfazed, the bartender simply stated, "Sorry, we don't serve beer to belligerent, bullying bears in bars in Billings who are on drugs."

To this the bear snarled, "I'm NOT on drugs ! ! ! !"

The bartender smiled engagingly while saying, "You are now. That was a barbitchyouate."

A woman woke in the middle of the night to find her husband missing from their bed. In the stillness of the house, she could hear a muffled sound downstairs.

She went downstairs and looked all around, still not finding her husband. Listening again, she could definitely hear moaning. She went down to the basement to find her husband, crouched in the corner facing the wall, sobbing.

"What's wrong with you?" She asked him.

"Remember when your father caught us having sex when you were 16?" he replied. "And remember he said, I had two choices: I could either marry you, or spend the next 20 years in prison."

Baffled, she said, "Yes, I remember, so what?"

"I would have gotten out today."

Sir Ernest Rutherford, President of the Royal Academy, and recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics, related the following story:

Some time ago I received a call from a colleague. He was about to give a student a zero for his answer to a physics question, while the student claimed a perfect score. The instructor and the student agreed to an impartial arbiter, and I was selected. I read the examination question:

"Show how it is possible to determine the height of a tall building with the aid of a barometer."

The student had answered: "Take the barometer to the top of the building, attach a long rope to it, lower it to the street, and then bring it up, measuring the length of the rope. The length of the rope is the height of the building."

The student really had a strong case for full credit since he had really answered the question completely and correctly! On the other hand, if full credit were given, it could well contribute to a high grade in his physics course and certify competence in physics, but the answer did not confirm this.

I suggested that the student have another try. I gave the student six minutes to answer the question with the warning that the answer should show some knowledge of physics. At the end of five minutes, he hadn't written anything. I asked if he wished to give up, but he said he had many answers to this problem; he was just thinking of the best one.

I excused myself for interrupting him and asked him to please go on. In the next minute, he dashed off his answer, which read, "Take the barometer to the top of the building and lean over the edge of the roof. Drop the barometer, timing its fall with a stopwatch. Then, using the formula x=0.5*a*t^2, calculate the height of the building."

At this point, I asked my colleague if he would give up. He conceded, and gave the student almost full credit. While leaving my colleague's office, I recalled that the student had said that he had other answers to the problem, so I asked him what they were.

"Well," said the student, "there are many ways of getting the height of a tall building with the aid of a barometer. For example, you could take the barometer out on a sunny day and measure the height of the barometer, the length of its shadow, and the length of the shadow of the building, and by the use of simple proportion, determine the height of the building."

"Fine," I said, "and others?"

"Yes," said the student, "there is a very basic measurement method you will like. In this method, you take the barometer and begin to walk up the stairs. As you climb the stairs, you mark off the length of the barometer along the wall. You then count the number of marks, and this will give you the height of the building in barometer units. A very direct method."

"Of course. If you want a more sophisticated method, you can tie the barometer to the end of a string, swing it as a pendulum, and determine the value of g [gravity] at the street level and at the top of the building. From the difference between the two values of g, the height of the building, in principle, can be calculated."

"On this same tack, you could take the barometer to the top of the building, attach a long rope to it, lower it to just above the street, and then swing it as a pendulum. You could then calculate the height of the building by the period of the precession".

"Finally," he concluded, "there are many other ways of solving the problem. Probably the best," he said, "is to take the barometer to the basement and knock on the superintendent's door. When the superintendent answers, you speak to him as follows: 'Mr. Superintendent, here is a fine barometer. If you will tell me the height of the building, I will give you this barometer.'"

At this point, I asked the student if he really did not know the conventional answer to this question. He admitted that he did, but said that he was fed up with high school and college instructors trying to teach him how to think.

The student was Niels Bohr (1885-1962), Danish Physicist, Nobel-Prize winner in 1922, best known for proposing the first 'model' of the atom with protons and neutrons, and various energy states of the surrounding electrons--the familiar icon of the small nucleus circled by three elliptical orbits … but more significantly, an innovator in Quantum Theory.

Two very elderly ladies were enjoying the sunshine on a park bench in Miami. They had been meeting in that park every sunny day for over 12 years, chatting and enjoying each others' friendship.

One day, the younger of the two ladies turns to the other and says, "Please don't be angry with me, dear, but I am embarrassed. After all these years, what is your name? I am trying to remember, but I just can't."

The older friend stares at her, looking very distressed, saying nothing for two full minutes. Finally, with tearful eyes, she says, "How soon do you have to know?"

In an earlier time Switzerland was flat. Flat and featureless from border to border.

Oh! how the Swiss longed for mountains and valleys, hills and lakes and rivers, anything to break the geographic monotony.

One day God appeared in a Zurich outdoor cafe where the nation's elite were having schnapps.

"Elites," he said, "I have heard the pleas of the good people of Switzerland for a full-featured landscape. I am here to give you what you long for."

He instantly disappeared and in the distance there arose a majestic mountain. Soon came another, then another. Over the next four days magnificent mountains large and larger popped up all over Switzerland.

When the landscape reached the full verticality we know today, God turned to making lakes and rivers to reflect the beauty of the mountains, and also to provide opportunities for ferries and water taxis.

Beginning in sight of the Zurich cafe and spreading out to every corner of the Swiss countryside, there appeared the world's finest collection of rippling lakes, restful rivers, and babbling brooks and rills.

When his 6-day odyssey was finished and geographic perfection attained, God returned to the Zurich cafe at schnapps time for a last chat with the country's delighted leaders.

They were overflowing with gratitude for the sheer magnificence their country had become, and were nearly awed by the presence before them.

"Thank you for this most wonderful gift," the elite of elites spokesman said, in the local dialect of his regional Switzerdeutsch. "Can we do anything for you in return?"

"Well not really," God replied, "though I would like a taste of that schnapps you all seem to like so much."

A waiter was summoned, schnapps was brought, and God sipped first, then tossed it down.

"My, that is good," opined God.

"And a bargain," said the lead elite. "Look at the bill. They only charged you 30 francs plus tax and tip."

Dear Dr. Laura,

Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's law. I have learned a great deal from you, and I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind him that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate. I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the specific laws and how to best follow them.

When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. How should I deal with this?

I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as it suggests in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?

I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.

Lev. 25:44 states that I may buy slaves from the nations that are around us. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans but not Canadians. Can you clarify?

I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?

A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination (Lev. 10:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?

Lev. 20:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?

I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.

Famed actor and last of the great British theatrical knights, Sir John Gielgud passed away last week at the age of 96, creating the opening to shoot "Weekend At Bernie's 3" as early as this week.

"John was a great actor. I've never really seen his work, but I'm told he was," said Hollywood director Vince Lee, carefully adjusting the actor's corpse into an appropriately wacky position on either side of Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman for the screen test.

"Finally though, we have the acting clout needed to make this project a 'go' picture." The film will be shot entirely on location in Sir John's home outside London and his beach house on England's South coast.

"I'm glad we waited for John. We almost made the movie last summer with Bob Hope. But John is real class," Lee said. "And he's actually dead."

Once upon a time, in a land far away, a beautiful, independent, self-assured princess, happened upon a frog as she sat contemplating ecological issues on the shores of an unpolluted pond in a verdant meadow near her castle.

The frog hopped into the Princess' lap and said: "Elegant Lady, I was once a handsome Prince, until an evil witch cast a spell upon me."

"One kiss from you, however, and I will turn back into the dapper, young Prince that I am and then, my sweet, we can marry and set up housekeeping in yon castle with my Mother, where you can prepare my meals, clean my clothes, bear my children, and forever feel grateful and happy doing so."

That night, on a repast of lightly saut&eacute;ed frogs legs seasoned in a white wine and onion cream sauce, she chuckled to herself and thought: "I don't f***ing think so."

20\. Your Honor, all of our arguments have been posted on www.judgeswifenaked.com.

19\. But I appeared in a commercial wearing a sweater! Would an evil overlord of an industry-crippling monopoly appear on TV wearing a *sweater*?

18> Okay, let me get this straight: You're saying you want us to have *two* monopolies instead of one?!?

17> Her first name ain't Baby, it's Janet — Miss Reno if you're nasty!

16> Continue with this foolishness, mortal, and I will be forced to unleash the vengeance of my 500-foot metal battle-robot, Mechasoft!

15> This court has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down. [Close] [Details]

14> Splitting the company would leave the whole world domination thing wide open for Oprah.

13> Our reasons for appealing this judgement are myriad and a bit complicated to explain because you people are — no offense — WAY too stupid to understand.

12> Isn't anyone at all concerned that McDonalds sells breakfast AND lunch?

11> Once we start splitting, there'll be no end to it. We'll continue multiplying and dominating every market we enter. Beware the tribble factor!!

10> We've got fifteen million reasons to throw out this case — in small, unmarked bills.

9> Divestiture will restrict the free flow of pornography guaranteed to all Americans by the Bill of Rights.

8> If Windows and our applications can't work together, the system may become unstable and prone to crashing… Ha!! Just a little humor, Your Honor!!

6> Lay off or the animated paperclip gets it!

5> We've begun the split, Your Honor, by appointing Donato the head of one company and Marisleysis the head of the other.

The southern preacher rose with a red face. "Someone in this congregation has spread a rumor that I belong to the KKK This is a horrible lie and one which a Christian community cannot tolerate. I am embarrassed and do not intend to accept this. Now I want the party who did this to stand and ask forgiveness from God and this Christian family."

No one moved. The preacher continued, "Do you not have the nerve to face me and admit this is a falsehood. Remember, you will be forgiven and in your heart you will feel glory. Now stand and confess your transgression."

Again all was quiet. Slowly a "drop dead" gorgeous blonde with a body that would not stop rose from the third pew. Her head was bowed and voice quivered as she spoke.

"Reverend there has been a terrible misunderstanding. I never said you were a member of the Ku Klux Klan. I told a couple of my friends that you were a wizard under the sheets!"

OY!

In the Beginning,
God created the Heaven and the Earth.
And the Earth was without form, and void,
and darkness was upon the face of the deep.
And the Devil said, "It doesn't get any better than this."
And God said, "Let there be light"
And there was light.
And God said,
"Let the earth bring forth grass,
The herb yielding seed,
And the fruit tree yielding fruit,"
And God saw that it was good.
And the Devil said,
"There goes the neighborhood."
And God said,
"Let us make Man in our image,
After our likeness,
And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
And over the fowl of the air
And over the cattle,
And over all the Earth,
And over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth."
And so God created Man in His own image;
Male and female He created them.
And God looked upon Man and Woman
And saw that they were lean and fit.
And the Devil said,
"I know how I can get back in this game."
And God populated the earth
With broccoli and cauliflower and spinach
And green and yellow vegetables of all kinds,
So Man and Woman would live long and healthy lives.
And the Devil created McDonald's.
And McDonald's brought forth
The 79-cent double cheeseburger.
And Man gained five pounds.
And God created the healthful yogurt,
That woman might keep her figure
That man found so fair.
And the Devil brought forth chocolate.
And Woman gained five pounds.
And God said,
"Try my crispy fresh salad."
And the Devil brought forth Ben and Jerry's.
And Woman gained 10 pounds.
And God said,
"I have sent thee heart-healthy vegetables
And olive oil with which to cook them."
And the Devil brought forth chicken fried steak
So big it needed its own platter.
And Man gained 10 pounds
And his bad cholesterol went through the roof.
And God brought forth running shoes.
And Man resolved to lose those extra pounds.
And the Devil brought forth cable TV with remote control
So Man would not have to toil
To change channels between ESPN and ESPN2.
And Man gained another 20 pounds.
And God said,
"You're running up the score, Devil."
And God brought forth the potato,
A vegetable naturally low in fat and brimming with nutrition.
And the Devil peeled off the healthful skin
And sliced the starchy center into chips and deep-fat fried them.
And the Devil created sour cream dip.
And Man clutched his remote control
And ate the potato chips swaddled in cholesterol.
And the Devil saw and said,
"It is good."
And Man went into cardiac arrest.
And God sighed and created quadruple bypass surgery.
And the Devil canceled Man's health insurance.
Then God showed Woman how to peel the skin off chicken
And cook the nourishing whole grain brown rice.
And the Devil created light beer
So Man could poison his body,
While feeling righteous because he had to drink
Twice as much of the now-insipid brew to get the same buzz.
And Man gained another 10 pounds.
And God created the life giving tofu.
And Woman ventured forth
Into the land of Godiva chocolate,
And upon returning asked Man,
"Do I look fat?"
And the Devil said,
"Always tell the truth."
And Man did.
And Woman went out from the presence of man
And dwelt in the land of the divorce lawyer,
East of the marriage counselor.
And Woman put aside the seeds of the earth
And took unto herself comfort food.
And God brought forth Weight-watchers.
It didn't help.
And God created exercise machines with easy payments.
And man brought forth his Visa at 21 percent.
And the exercise machine went to dwell
In the closet of Nod east of the polyester leisure suit.
And in the fullness of time,
Woman received the exercise machine from Man
In the property settlement.
It didn't help her, either.

How many women with PMS does it take to screw in a light bulb?

One.


ONE!! And do you know WHY it only takes ONE?
Because no one else in this house knows HOW to change a light
bulb. They don't even know the bulb is BURNED OUT. They would
sit in this house in the dark for THREE DAYS before they figured
it OUT. And once they figured it out they wouldn't be able to
find the lightbulbs despite the fact that they've been in the
SAME CUPBOARD for the past SEVENTEEN YEARS. But if they did,
by some miracle, find the lightbulbs, TWO DAYS LATER the chair
that they dragged from two rooms over to stand on to change the
STUPID lightbulb would STILL BE IN THE SAME SPOT!!!!! AND
UNDERNEATH IT WOULD BE THE CRUMPLED WRAPPER THE STUPID
LIGHT BULBS CAME IN. WHY??? BECAUSE NO ONE IN THIS
HOUSE EVER CARRIES OUT THE GARBAGE!!!! IT'S A WONDER WE HAVEN'T
ALL SUFFOCATED FROM PILES OF GARBAGE 12 FEET DEEP
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE HOUSE. THE HOUSE!! THE HOUSE!!! IT WOULD
TAKE AN ARMY TO CLEAN THIS …

That's how many.
