A old man could feel he was going to die soon and, although he had been financially successful beyond his wildest dreams, he hated everyone, including others of his own family.

He called his wife in and told her, “When I die, you must promise me something. I never liked any of you, so you’re not getting my money. I want you to bury all my money in my casket with me.”

His wife was taken aback, but she agreed.

Sure enough, the old man died. After the funeral, the kids gathered around mom. “Mom, did you do what dad asked you to do?”

Mom nodded solemnly. “Yes, I did. But there was so much money, it wouldn’t fit into the casket. So I wrote him a check.”
