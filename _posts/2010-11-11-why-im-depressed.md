Over five thousand years ago, Moses said to the children of Israel, “Pick up your shovels, mount your asses and camels, and I will lead you to the Promised Land.”  
  
Nearly 75 years ago, (when welfare was introduced) Roosevelt said, “Lay down your shovels, sit on your asses, and light up a Camel, this is the Promised Land.”

Today, Obama has stolen your shovel, taxed your asses, raised the price of camels, and mortgaged the Promised Land!

I was so depressed last night thinking about Health Care Plans, the economy, the wars, lost jobs, savings, Social Security, retirement funds, etc…. I called a Suicide Hotline. I had to press 1 for English. They connected me to a call center in Pakistan. I told them I was depressed and felt suicidal. They got excited and asked if I could drive a truck!
