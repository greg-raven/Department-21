A student played high school football in Detroit. He was a great running back, but a really poor student.

He didn't have enough credits to graduate, but he was a great football star and the students held a rally, demanding the principal give him a diploma anyway.

They were so insistent that the principal agreed if Dwayne could answer one question correctly he would give him a diploma.

The one question test was held in the auditorium and all the students packed the place. It was standing room only.

The principal was on the stage and told him to come up.

The principal had the diploma in his hand and said, "Dwayne, if you can answer this question correctly I'll give you your diploma."

He said he was ready and the principal asked him the question.

"Dwayne," he said, "How much is three times seven?"

He looked up at the ceiling and the down at his shoes, just pondering the question. The other students began chanting, "Graduate him anyway! Graduate him anyway!"

Then he held up his hand and the auditorium became silent. He said, "I think I know the answer.

"Three times seven is twenty-one."

A hush fell over the auditorium and all the other students began another chant â€¦

"Give him another chance! Give him another chance!"
