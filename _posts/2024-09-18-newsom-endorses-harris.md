Hi, I'm Gavin Newsom, the governor of California.

This is a message for the people of America, given in my authentically recorded non-AI voice.

Thanks to my leadership over the last several years, California has become a world leader in extremist left-wing governance. My policies were so effective that almost 1 million people are now fleeing the state every year. We even ran out of U-Hauls.

During the COVID pandemic I locked everyone in their homes and shut down businesses for months. Not the French Laundry, though. That's my favorite restaurant.

Last year I cleaned up the dangerous, messy streets of San Francisco, you know, because Chinese Communist president XI was coming, and I really wanted to impress him. He's my boss, after all.

This year, I signed legislation that allows me to take custody of your kid if you refuse to give him artificial hormones and chop off his genitals, because if you don't do that you're a bigot, and bigots shouldn't be allowed to have kids.

I've also led the way in green energy by banning all cars that don't run on electricity then I banned almost all the electricity. This is smart leadership.

On my watch, the cost of living in homelessness have skyrocketed, schools are failing, drug dealers and human traffickers are pouring across the border, and poop has covered the sidewalks of San Francisco. This is the positive joyful vision we offer as Democrats.

That's why I'm enthusiastically endorsing Cameluh Harris for president in 2024. She'll do to the country everything I did in California.

Anyway, I'm California governor Gavin Newsom and I approve this 100% real message, which is a recording of my voice without the assistance of any AI whatsoever. This isn't a deep fake, and you can rest assured that it isn't because I just signed an unconstitutional law outlawing deep fakes. No one would dare violate it.

Thank you and science bless America.
