A cannibal goes to the human meat market to buy a brain for his lunch (as one would). He sees a little poster that boasts about the quality of IT professional brains that are currently on sale.

He asks the sales assistant: "How much does the programmer's brain cost?"

"Three dollars per pound," replies the salesman.

"How much for an analyst's brain then?"

"Three dollars and fifty cents per pound."

"What about the user's brain?"

"One hundred and fifty dollars per pound."

"What? How can it cost that much?" he asks, astonished.

The salesman replies "Do you have any idea how many users I have to kill to get one pound of brain?"
