Your stationery has fax number, two e-mail addresses, and your Internet address.

You have two or more Internet Service Providers.

You disdain people who use low-baud screen refresh or MHz rates.

You rotate your screen savers more frequently than your automobile tires.

You need to fill out a form with a typewriter; but you only know computers with laser printers.

You would rather get more dots per inch than miles per gallon.

You think jokes about being unable to program a VCR are stupid.

You own a set of itty-bitty screwdrivers and you actually know where they are.

You think of gadgets as "friends," but forget to send real friends birthday cards.

You have a good copier and a fax, but your toaster turns bread into charcoal.

You use all the Internet terms in conversations without even thinking about it.

You sign cards by putting :-) next to your signature.

And worse: you can think of nineteen keystroke symbols that are far more clever!

The fact that the term "CD" could also refer to finance/music rarely occurs to you.

In a computer store, you answer the customers' questions; the salesperson listens.

You know hundreds of e-mail address and URLs, but not your social security number.

You stop saying "phone number" and replace it with the term "voice number."

You read computer manuals faster than everyone else reads fiction novels.

At computer trade shows you map out your path of the exhibit hall in advance.

And finally ...

You actually understood all the humor in this message.
