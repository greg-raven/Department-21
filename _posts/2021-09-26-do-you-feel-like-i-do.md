I am sorry I have not been very responsive lately. I have been somewhat under the weather. My doctors have diagnosed me as having an acute case of Post Islamic Stress Trauma with Apologetic White House Fatigue, AKA PIST-AWF.

PIST-AWF is a newly discovered disease that it is so contagious that it already has become widespread.

As of February, it had already infected over half of the United States and is anticipated to continue to spread. The disease itself affects the cells of a person's entire body then goes dormant. The disease ravages the body and leaves serious side effects including: embarrassment for your country, depression, anxiety as to when it will come to an end, wondering how much more damage he can do, and despairing that the damage may not be reversible.

Symptoms include:

- Severe pain of the scalp from pulling your hair while viewing your president pander to Taliban terrorists.

- Uncontrollable heartburn at 8:00 p.m. while watching CNN.

- Stomach cramps from swallowing the fact we elected Biden/Harris.

- Vomiting from viewing terrorists murdering innocent people routinely on the nightly news.

- Bleeding from the eyes after accidentally flipping to a channel that shows Al Sharpton as a so-called legitimate news show host.

Because the disease consumes the entire body, every infected person becomes part of the disease itself.

If you have these symptoms and consider yourself PIST-AWF, please notify your local election board and place your name on the list for a cure. It is expected, and sincerely hoped, that the cure will be available in 2022.
