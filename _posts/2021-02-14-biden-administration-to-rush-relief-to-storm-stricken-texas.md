The winter storm and lengthy cold snap have crippled power facilities in Texas and caused about 2.3 million outages as of Wednesday evening, leaving residents in the cold and dark for several days.

The solar panels feature the latest in Chinese technology, and are said to be lower in lead and arsenic than traditional Chinese solar panels.

Once the panels are installed in 2022, they will augment power from wind turbines, â…” of which froze in this storm due to global warming.
