Air Force General: Mr. President, we’ve just invented an invisibility clock for Air Force One.

Obama: No way!

General: That’s right, sir, the plane will be invisible. Will you be going along on the maiden flight?

Obama: Wouldn’t miss a good press opportunity for the world.

General: Have a good trip, sir.
