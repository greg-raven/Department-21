A Texas State Trooper pulled a car over near Ft. Hood and told the driver that because he had been wearing his seat belt, he had just won $5,000 dollars in the statewide safety competition. "What are you going to do with the money? " asked the policeman. "Well, I guess I'm going to get a driver's license," he answered. "Oh, don't listen to him, " yelled a woman in the passenger seat. "He's a smart aleck when he's drunk." This woke up the guy in the back seat, who took one look at the cop and moaned, "I knew we wouldn't get far in a stolen car." At that moment, there was a knock from the trunk and a voice asked, in Spanish, "Are we over the border yet?"
