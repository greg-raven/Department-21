A father told his three sons when he sent them to the university, "I feel it's my duty to provide you with the best possible education, and you do not owe me anything for that. However, I want you to appreciate it. As a token, please each put $1,000 into my coffin when I die."

And so it happened. His sons became a doctor, a lawyer, and a financial planner, each very successful financially. When their father's time had come and they saw their father in the coffin, they remembered his wish.

First, the doctor who put ten $100 bills onto the chest of his deceased father.

Then, came the financial planner, who also put in $1,000.

Finally, it was the lawyer son's turn. He took out his checkbook, wrote a check for $3,000, put it into his father's coffin, and took the $2,000 cash.

He later went on to become a member of Congress.
