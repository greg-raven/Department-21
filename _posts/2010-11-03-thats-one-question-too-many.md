A young Arab asks his father: “What is this weird hat that we are wearing?”  
  
“It’s a ‘chechia’ because it protects our heads from the sun in the sweltering heat of the desert!”

“And what is this type of clothing that we are wearing?”

“It’s a ‘djbellah’ because it protects your body from the soaring temperatures of the desert!”

“And what are these ugly shoes that we have on our feet?”

“These are ‘babouches’, which keep us from burning our feet when crossing the hot, blistering sands of the desert!”

“Tell me, papa …”

“Yes, my son?”

“You know there’s no desert here in Dearborn, Michigan, right?”
