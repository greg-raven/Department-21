One day God was looking down at earth and saw all of the rascally retirees’ behavior that was going on.

So He called His angels and sent one to earth for a time.

When the angel returned, he told God, “Yes, it is bad on earth: 95% of retirees are misbehaving and only 5% are not.”

God thought for a moment and said, “Maybe I had better send down a second angel to get another opinion.”

So God called another angel and sent her to earth for a time.

When the angel returned, she went to God and said, “Yes, it’s true. The earth is in decline: 95% of retirees are misbehaving, but 5% are being good.”

God was not pleased, so He decided to e-mail the 5% who were good, because He wanted to encourage them, and give them a little something to help them keep going.

Do you know what the e-mail said?

OK, I was just wondering, because I didn’t get one either.
