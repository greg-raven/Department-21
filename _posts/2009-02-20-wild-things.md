An old man was sitting on a bench at the mall. A young man walked up to the bench and sat down. He had spiked hair all different colors â€” green, red, orange, blue, and yellow.

The old man just stared.

The young man said, "What's the matter old timer, never done anything wild in your life?"

The old man replied, "The wildest thing I even did was to get so drunk I had sex with a parrot. I was just wondering if you were my son."
