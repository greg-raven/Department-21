Forgetting those keys? Wandering into a room, and then trying to determine why you’re there? Can’t remember the names anymore?

Then it’s time to take your annual senior citizen test.

Exercise of the brain is as important as exercise of the muscles. As we grow older, it’s important to keep mentally alert. If you don’t use it, you will lose it !!!

Here is a very private way to gauge how your memory compares to your last test. Some may think it is too easy, but the ones with memory problems may have difficulty.

Take this test to determine if you’re losing it or not.

OK, relax, clear your mind, and begin.

**1. What do you put in a toaster?**

Answer: “Bread.”

If you said “toast,” just give up now and go do something else, and try not to hurt yourself.

If you said, bread, go to Question #2.

**2. Say “silk” ten times. Now spell “silk.” What do cows drink?**

Answer: Cows drink water.

If you said “milk,” don’t attempt the next question. Your brain is already over-stressed and may even overheat. Content yourself with reading more appropriate literature such as Women’s Weekly or Auto World.

However, if you did say “water,” proceed to Question #3.

**3. If a red house is made from red bricks and a blue house is made from blue bricks and a pink house is made from pink bricks and a black house is made from black bricks, what is a green house made from?**

Answer: Greenhouses are made from glass.

If you said “green bricks,” why are you still reading this? PLEASE, go lie down!

But, if you said “glass,” go on to Question #4.

**4. Please do not use a calculator for this for it would be cheating:**

You are driving a bus from New York City to Philadelphia.

In Staten Island, 17 people got on the bus.

In New Brunswick, 6 people get off the bus and 9 people get on.

In Windsor, 2 people get off and 4 get on.

In Trenton, 11 people get off and 16 people get on.

In Bristol, 3 people get off and 5 people get on.

And, in Camden, 6 people get off and 3 get on.

You then arrive at Philadelphia Station.

Without going back to review, how old is the bus driver?

Answer: Oh, for crying out loud! Don’t you remember your own age? It was *you* driving the bus!

P.S.: 95% of people fail most of the questions!
