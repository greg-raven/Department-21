My wife and I went to the fair and one of the first exhibits we stopped at was the breeding bulls. We went up to the first pen and there was a sign attached that read:

“THIS BULL MATED 50 TIMES LAST YEAR.”

We walked to the second pen which had a sign attached that read:

“THIS BULL MATED 150 TIMES LAST YEAR”

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large">![](/assets/2021/07/bull2.jpg)</figure></div>My wife gave me a healthy jab and said, “Wow! That’s more than twice a week! You could learn a lot from him.”

We walked to the third pen and it had a sign attached that read:

“THIS BULL MATED 365 TIMES LAST YEAR”

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large">![](/assets/2021/07/bull3.jpg)</figure></div>My wife was so excited that her elbow nearly broke my ribs, and exclaimed, “That’s once a day. You could *really* learn something from this one.”

I looked at her and said, “Go over and ask him if it was with the same cow.”

My condition has been upgraded from critical to stable and I should eventually make a full recovery.
