This is a story of self control and marksmanship with an itsy bitsy shooter, by a woman, against a fierce predator.  
  
What is the smallest caliber you trust to protect yourself? The Beretta Jetfire:

"While out hiking in Alberta Canada with my boyfriend we were surprised by a huge grizzly bear charging at us from out of nowhere. She must have been protecting her cubs because she was extremely aggressive. If I had not had my little Beretta Jetfire with me I would not be here today! Just one shot to my boyfriend's knee cap was all it took â€¦ the bear got him and I was able to escape by just walking away at a brisk pace."
