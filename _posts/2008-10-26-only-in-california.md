This could only happen in California ... (true story)

An elderly lady did her shopping and upon return found 4 males in her car. She dropped her shopping bags and drew her handgun, proceeding to scream at them at the top of her voice that she knew how to use it and that she would if required ... so get out of the car!

The four men didn't wait around for a second invitation but got out and ran like mad, where upon the lady proceeded to load her shopping bags into the back of the car and got into the drivers seat.

Small problem: her key wouldn't fit the ignition. Her car was identical and parked four or five spaces farther down.

She reloaded her bags into her own car and drove to the police station. The sergeant that she told the story to nearly laughed himself in half and pointed to the other end of the counter where 4 pale white males were reporting a carjacking by a mad elderly white woman.

No charges were filed.
