There is a certain organization here in the U.S. Of the members of this organization:

- 36 have been accused of spousal abuse
- 7 have been arrested for fraud
- 19 have been accused of writing bad checks
- 117 have directly or indirectly bankrupted at least 2 businesses
- 3 have done time for assault
- 71 cannot get a credit card due to bad credit
- 14 have been arrested on drug-related charges
- 8 have been arrested for shoplifting
- 21 currently are defendants in lawsuits
- 84 have been arrested for drunk driving In the last year

Can you guess which organization this is? Would you guess the NBA? How about the NFL?

Neither. Itâ€™s the 535 members of the United States Congress.

This same group of idiots cranks out hundreds of new laws each year to keep the rest of us in line.
