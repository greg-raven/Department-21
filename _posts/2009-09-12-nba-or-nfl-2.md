There is a certain organization here in the U.S. Of the members of this organization:

- 36 have been accused of spousal abuse

- 7 have been arrested for fraud

- 19 have been accused of writing bad checks

- 117 have directly or indirectly bankrupted at least two businesses

- 3 have done time for assault

- 71 cannot get a credit card due to bad credit

- 14 have been arrested on drug-related charges

- 8 have been arrested for shoplifting

- 21 currently are defendants in lawsuits

- 84 have been arrested for drunk driving in the last year

Can you guess which organization this is? Would you guess the NBA? How about the NFL?

Neither. It's the 535 members of the United States Congress.

This same group of idiots cranks out hundreds of new laws each year to keep the rest of us in line.
