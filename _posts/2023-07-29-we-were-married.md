Miss Jones, a blonde, was a not too bright girl who had moved to Hollywood with dreams of becoming a star. She didn't find fame or glory, but she did encounter plenty of men willing to enjoy her plentiful charms and eventually she found herself named in divorce case.

When it was her turn on the stand, the prosecutor came forward. "Miss Jones, the wife of the defendant has identified you as the other woman in her husband's life. Now, do you admit that you went to the Dew Drop Inn with Mr. Smith?"

"Well, yes," acknowledges Miss Jones with a sniffle, "but I couldn't help it."

"Couldn't help it?" asked the lawyer incredulously. "How's that?"

"Mr. Smith deceived me."

"Exactly what do you mean?"

"See, when we signed in," she explained, "he told the motel clerk I was his wife."
