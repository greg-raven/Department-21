I’ve just started work as a human chess piece. I’m on knights next week.

I just built a car without a reverse gear or a steering wheel. It’s all quite straight forward really.

A man who took an airline company to court after his luggage went missing has lost his case.

I went to a strange place where veryone was wearing a jumper one size too small. It was a tight-knit community.

I regret buying that straitjacket. Thought it would look good on me but I just can’t pull it off.

Just been to a concert to watch the Bermuda Philharmonic Orchestra. Halfway through, the guy on the triangle disappeared.
