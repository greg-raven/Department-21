Different pets have profoundly different personalities. Some are smarter than others, some more willing to help “their” humans. When critters are asked to change the light bulb, their replies vary dramatically:

Afghan: Light bulb? What light bulb?

Golden Retriever: The sun is shining, the day is young, we’ve got our whole lives ahead of us, and you’re worrying about a burned out light bulb?

Border Collie: Right away. And I’ll replace any wiring that’s not up to code.

Daschund: I can’t reach the stupid lamp!

Toy Poodle: I’ll just blow in the border collie’s ear and he’ll do it.

Rotweiller: Go ahead! Make me!

Shi-tzu: Pul-leeze, dahling, I have servants for that kind of thing.

Lab: Oh, me, me!!!! Pleeeeeasze let me change the light bulb. Can I? Can I? Huh? Huh? Can I?

Malamute: Let the Border Collie do it. You can feed me while he’s busy.

Cocker Spaniel: Why change it? I can still pee in the dark.

Doberman Pinscher: While it’s dark, I’m going to sleep on the couch.

Mastiff: Mastiffs are NOT afraid of the dark.

Hound Dog: ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

Chihuahua: You quiro Taco Bulb.

Irish Wolfhound: Can somebody else do it? I’ve got a hangover.

Pointer: I see it, there it is, right there.

Greyhound: It isn’t moving. Who cares?

Australian Shepherd: Put all the light bulbs in a little circle.

Beagle: Light bulb? That thing I ate was a light bulb?

Siberian Husky: Light bulb?!? I ate the light bulb, and the lamp, and the coffee table it sat on, and the carpet under the coffee table and …

Cat: You need light to see?
