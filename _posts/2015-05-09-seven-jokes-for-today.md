Just seen a very confusing book: "Ventriloquism for Dummies."

Dave drowned, so for his funeral we got him a wreath in the shape of a lifebelt. It's what he would have wanted.

A man has been found guilty of stealing periods. The judge says he's facing a long sentence.

Two larger ladies spotted at the bar. "You girls from Scotland?"  
"Wales, you idiot!"  
"Oh sorry: You whales from Scotland?"

At the bank the other day, a little old lady asked me to help her check her balance, so I pushed her over.
