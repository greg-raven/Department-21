An Asian man walks into the currency exchange in New York with 2,000 yen and walks out with $72.

Next week he walks in with 2,000 yen, gets $66. He asks the lady why he got less money this week than last week. The lady says "Fluctuations".

The Asian man turns to storm out, and just before slamming the door behind himself turns and says, "Fluc you clazy Amelicans too!"
