A young man asks for a ticket for an R-rated movie and hands me his ID. I'm about to sell him the ticket when the lady behind him speaks up.

Lady: "Wait! That picture in the ID doesn't look like him at all!"

I look at the ID. It appears he's been sick since the photo was taken, but it's clearly the same guy.

Me: "Well, ma'am, I'm fairly certain that this is the correct ID. Now, if you'd just step up -–"

Lady: "No! You can't sell to someone with a fake ID. He could be a terrorist, for God's sake! You should call the police!"

Me: "Ma'am, that is definitely not necessary. I am responsible for checking identification, and I -–"

Lady: "I need to talk to your manager!"

I begin to respond, but the guy politely waves me off and turns to the woman.

Man: "Miss, I have another photo ID here, with a more recent picture. Do you think this matches?"

He pulls a card out of his wallet and hands it to her. She goes completely white.

Lady: "Well … um … yes, that's, uh, fine!"

She squirms for a moment, then exclaims, "I'll be right back!" She drops the card and leaves the theater in a hurry. I give the guy his ticket.

Me: "What was that you showed her?"

Man: "Oh, my handgun permit."
