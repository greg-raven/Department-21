A man and a friend are playing golf one day at their local golf course. One of the guys is about to chip onto the green when he sees a long funeral procession on the road next to the course. He stops in mid-swing, takes off his golf cap, closes his eyes, and bows down in prayer.  
  
His friend says, “Wow, that is the most thoughtful and touching thing I have ever seen. You truly are a kind man.”

The man then replies, “Yeah, well we were married 35 years.”
