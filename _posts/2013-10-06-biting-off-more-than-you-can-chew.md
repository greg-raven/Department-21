A guy who lives at Grand Lake Saint Marys (60 miles north of Dayton, Ohio) saw what looked to be a ball bouncing around strangely in the lake and went to investigate.  
  
It turned out to be a flathead catfish that had apparently tried to swallow a basketball that became stuck in its mouth!

The fish was totally exhausted from trying to dive unsuccessfully, because the buoyancy of the ball would always bring him back up to the surface.

The guy tried numerous times to get the ball out, but was unsuccessful. He finally had his wife cut the ball in order to deflate it and release the hungry catfish.

You probably wouldn't have believed this if you hadn't seen the pictures.
