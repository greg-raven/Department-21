A young couple got married and went on their honeymoon. After they got back, the bride immediately called her mother.

Her mother asked, "How was the honeymoon?"

"Oh, mama," she replied, "the honeymoon was wonderful! So romantic ..."

Suddenly she burst out crying. "But, mama, as soon as we returned Sam started using the most horrible language ... things I'd never heard before! I mean, all these awful 4-letter words! You've got to come get me and take me home ... Please mama!"

"Sarah, Sarah," her mother said, "calm down! Tell me, what could be so awful? What 4-letter words?"

"Please don't make me tell you, mama," wept the daughter, "I'm so embarrassed they're just too awful! Come get me, please!"

"Darling, baby, you must tell me what has you so upset ... Tell your mother these horrible 4-letter words!"

Still sobbing, the bride said, "Oh, mama ... words like DUST, WASH, IRON, COOK ...!"
