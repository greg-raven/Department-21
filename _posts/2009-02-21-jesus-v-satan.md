Jesus and Satan were having an ongoing argument about who had better computer skills. They had been going at it for days, and God was tired of hearing all of the bickering. Finally God said, “Cool it. I am going test you, and after two hours I will judge who does the better job.”

So down Satan and Jesus sat at the keyboards and typed away. They moused. They did spreadsheets. They wrote reports. They sent faxes. They sent e-mail. They sent out e-mail with attachments. They downloaded. They did some genealogy reports. They made cards. They did every known job.

About ten minutes before their time was up, lightning flashed across the sky, thunder rolled, the rain poured, and, of course, the electricity went off. Satan stared at his blank screen and screamed every curse word known in the underworld. Jesus just sighed.

The electricity finally flickered back on, and each of them rebooted their computers. Satan started searching frantically, screaming, “It’s gone! It’s all gone! I lost everything when the power went out.”

Meanwhile, Jesus quietly started printing out all of his files from the past two hours. Satan observed this and became very irate. “Wait! He must have cheated. How did he do that?”

God shrugged and said, “Jesus saves.”
