So, how's that "hope" and "change" working out for you?

You can't blame Bush anymore!

1.5 million people attended the inauguration and only 14 missed work.

Warning: I'm a bitter Christian clinging to my guns.

If you think health care is expensive now, wait until it's free.

Keep the change ... I'll keep my freedom, my guns, and my money.

Annoy a liberal ... use facts and logic.

The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money.

How will Democrats stand up to terrorists when they can't even stand up to Fox News?

Don't spread my wealth, spread my work ethic.

Look out taxpayers, Obama thinks you're rich.
