Two mule traders, Curtis and Leroy, saw an ad for a mule in the paper and agreed to buy it for $100.

The farmer was to deliver the mule the next day.

The next morning the farmer arrive and said, "Sorry, fellows, I have some bad news. The mule died last night."

Curtis and Leroy replied, "Well, then just give us our money back."

The farmer said, "Can't do that. I went and spent it already."

They said, "OK then, just bring us the dead mule."

The farmer asked, "What in the world ya'll gonna do with a dead mule?"

Curtis said, "We gonna raffle him off."

The farmer said, "You can't raffle off a dead mule!"

Leroy said, "We shore can! Heck, we don't hafta tell nobody he's dead!"

A couple of weeks later, the farmer ran into Curtis and Leroy at the grocery store and asked "What'd you fellers ever do with that dead mule?"

They said, "We raffled him off like we said we wuz gonna do."

Leroy said, "Shucks, we sold 1,000 tickets fer two dollars apiece and made a profit of $1,998.

The farmer said, "My Lord, didn't anyone complain?"

Curtis said, "Well, the feller who won got upset. So we gave him his two dollars back."

Curtis and Leroy now work for the government.
