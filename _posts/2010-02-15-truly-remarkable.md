I think it is remarkable that within a week of Tiger Woods crashing his escalade, the press found every woman with whom Tiger has had an affair in the last few years, with photos, text messages, recorded phone calls, etc.  
  
And, they not only know the cause of the fight, but they even know it was a wedge from his golf bag that his wife used to break out the windows in the Escalade. Not only that, they know which wedge!

And each and every day, they give America more updates on his sex-rehab stay, his wife's plans for divorce, and his plans to return to the pro-golf circuit.

Obama has been in office for over a year now, and this same press still cannot locate Obama's official birth certificate, or any of his papers while in college, or how he paid for a Harvard education, or which country issued his visa to travel to Pakistan in the 1980's as Barry Soetoro, or even Michelle Obama's Princeton thesis on racism. It just can't be found.

Yet the public still trusts that same press?
