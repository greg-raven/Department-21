An old man and woman were married for years even though they hated each other. When they had a confrontation, screaming and yelling could be heard deep into the night. The neighbors feared the man the most. He was constantly heard stating, “When I die I will dig my way up and out of the grave to come back and haunt you for the rest of your life!”

They believed he practiced black magic and was responsible for missing cats and dogs, and for strange sounds at all hours. He was feared and enjoyed the respect it garnished.

He died abruptly under strange circumstances and the funeral had a closed casket. After the burial, the wife went straight to the local bar and began to party as if there were no tomorrow.

The gaiety of her actions was becoming extreme while her neighbors approached in a group to ask these questions: “Are you not afraid? Concerned? Worried? This man who practiced black magic stated that when he died he would dig his way up and out of the grave to come back and haunt you for the rest of your life.”

The wife put down her drink and said, “Let the jerk dig. I had him buried upside down.”
