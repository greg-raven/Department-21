A teacher asked her 6th grade class how many of them were Obama fans.

Not really knowing what an Obama fan is, but wanting to be liked by the teacher, each kid raised his hand except for Little Johnny.

The teacher asked Little Johnny why he has decided to be different, again.

Little Johnny said, "Because I'm not an Obama fan."

The teacher asked, "Why aren't you an Obama fan?"

Johnny said, "Because I'm a Republican."

The teacher asked him why he's a Republican.

Little Johnny answered, "Well, my Mom's a Republican, and my Dad's a Republican, so I'm a Republican."

Annoyed by this answer, the teacher asked, "If your mom was a moron, and if your dad was an idiot, what would that make you?"

With a big smile, Little Johnny replied, "That would make me an Obama fan."
