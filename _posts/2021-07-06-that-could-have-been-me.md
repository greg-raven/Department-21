I was sitting at a red light yesterday, minding my own business, patiently waiting for it to turn green even though there was no cross traffic. After a few moments, another car pulled to a stop next to me. Inside was a load of scruffy-bearded young men shouting anti-American slogans. They had a half-burned American flag duct-taped on the trunk and "Remember George Floyd" spray painted on the side.

They looked over at me and yelled, "Defund the police!" Without waiting for the light to change, they darted out into the intersection.

At that moment, an 18-wheeler entered the crossroads and T-boned their car, crushing it completely and killing everyone inside.

For several minutes I sat in my car thinking, "Man â€¦ that coulda been me!"

So, bright and early this morning, I went out and got a job as a truck driver.
