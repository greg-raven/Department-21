A highway patrolman spotted a car exceeding the speed limit on a rural highway, so he hit the lights and siren and attempted to pull it over.

Instead of stopping, though, the car accelerated and made several turns in an apparent attempt to get away.

Ten miles later, the speeding car finally pulled to the side of the road and came to a stop.

The highway patrolman approached the car and the driver rolled down his window.

ÂºWhat the heck is wrong with you," the patrolman angrily demanded of the driver. "Didn't you see me behind you?"

The driver responded, "Yeah, I saw you. But my wife ran off with a highway patrolman last week and I thought you might be trying to bring her back."
