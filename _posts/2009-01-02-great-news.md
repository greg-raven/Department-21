A woman gets home, screeches her car into the driveway, runs into the house, slams the door and shouts at the top of her lungs: "Honey, pack your bags! I won the lottery!"

The husband says, "Oh my God! What should I pack: Beach stuff or mountain stuff?"

The wife yells back, "It doesn't matter â€¦ just get out!"
