In Washington, D.C., an old priest lay dying in the hospital. For years he had faithfully served the people of the nation’s capital and was well known among the elected officials. He motioned for his nurse to come near.  
  
“Yes, Father?” said the nurse.

“I would really like to see President Obama and Senator Reid before I die,” whispered the priest.

“I’ll see what I can do, Father”, replied the nurse.

The nurse sent the request to The President and Congress and waited for a response.

Soon the word arrived; Obama and Reid announced they would visit the priest.

When they arrived at the priest’s room, the priest took Obama’s hand in his right hand and Reid’s hand in his left hand. There was silence and a look of serenity on the old priest’s face. Finally Obama spoke. “Father, of all the people you could have chosen, why did you choose us to be with you as you near the end?”

The old priest slowly replied, “I have always tried to pattern my life after our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.”

Obama and Reid each nodded noncomittally.

The old priest continued, “Jesus died between two lying thieves; I would like to do the same.”
