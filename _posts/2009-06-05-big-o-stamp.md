The U.S. Postal Service created a stamp with a picture of Resident Obama. There was one problem, though: The stamp was not sticking to envelopes.

This enraged Obama, who demanded a full investigation.

After a month of testing and $1.73 million in studies, a Congressional panel presented its findings: The stamp is in perfect order. There is nothing wrong with the adhesive. People are spitting on the wrong side.
