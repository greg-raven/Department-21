While doing an annual physical checkup of a 75 year old rancher, the doctor struck up a conversation with his patient. Eventually the topic got around to Obama's job as president.

The old rancher said, "Well, you know, Obama is a 'post turtle'."

Not being familiar with the term, the doctor asked him what a post turtle was.

The old rancher replied, "When you're driving down a road and you come across a fence post with a turtle balanced on top, that's a post turtle."

The old rancher saw the puzzled look on the doctor's face so he continued to explain.

"You know he didn't get up there by himself, he doesn't belong up there, and he doesn't know what to do while he's up there. You have to wonder what kind of idiot put him up there to begin with."
