Four friends were taking a cross country car trip together. One was from Florida, one was from New York, one was from Idaho, and one was from Iowa.

Half way into the trip, amazed by all the great scenery he had seen, the guy from Idaho started throwing potatoes out the window. The others asked, "What are you doing?" The guy from Idaho said, "I'm tired of potatoes. Potatoes, potatoes, potatoes. All I've even seen in my life are potatoes. So I'm getting rid of them."

They were riding in silence when the guy from Iowa started throwing corn out the window. The other passengers all asked, "What are you doing?" The guy from Iowa said, "I'm tired of corn. Corn, corn, corn. All I've even seen in my life is corn. So I'm getting rid of it."

They were riding in silence again when suddenly the guy from Florida pushed the guy from New York out of the car.
