I’ve won a Kenyan Lottery, according to an e-mail I just received from a Nigerian prince! He has 5 MILLION DOLLARS, and he wants to send it to me FREE! All I have to do is give him all my BANK ACCOUNT NUMBERS so he can transfer the money!

And then I got ANOTHER NOTICE …

It is from a Kenyan, and he wants to give me FREE healthcare for life (it will cost me only an extra $500.00 a month in premiums)!

And all I have to do is give him all my BANK ACCOUNT NUMBERS, my SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER, and my CONFIDENTIAL HEALTH INFORMATION so he can make it happen!

Am I lucky, or what?
