A game warden in Central Mississippi recently stopped a redneck who was leaving a well-known fishing cove carrying a ice chest full of fish.

The game warden asked the man, "Do you have a license to catch those fish?"

"No, sir," replied the redneck. "I ain't got none of them there licenses. But, these here are my pet fish."

"Pet fish?"

"Yeah. Every night, I take these here fish down to the lake and let 'em swim 'round for awhile. Then, when I whistle, they jump right back into these here ice chests and I take 'em home."

The game warden says, "That's a bunch of hooey! Fish can't do that."

The redneck looked at the warden for a moment and then said, "It's the truth Mr. Government Man. I'll show ya, if ya want."

"OK," said the warden. "I've got to see this!"

The two walked back to the cove and the redneck poured the fish into the water.

After several minutes standing there waiting, the warden said, "Well?"

"'Well' what?" responded the redneck.

The warden asked, "When are you going to call them back?"

"Call who back?"

"The fish!" demanded the warden.

"What fish?" asked the redneck.
