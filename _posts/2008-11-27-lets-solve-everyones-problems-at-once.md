Everyone concentrates on the problems we’re having in this country currently: Illegal immigration, hurricane recovery, and alligators attacking people in Florida.  
  
Not me. I concentrate on solutions for the problems. It’s a win-win situation.

- Dig a moat the length of the Mexican border.
- Send the dirt to New Orleans to raise the level of the levies.
- Put the Florida alligators in the moat along the Mexican border.
