The Department of Defense briefed Resident Obama this morning telling him that two Brazilian soldiers had been killed in Afganistan. To everyone’s surprise all the color drained from his face. Then he collapsed onto his desk, head in his hands, visibly shaken, almost in tears.

Finally he composed himself and asked, “Just how many is a Brazilian?”

This is not surprising, as he obviously has no understanding of billion or [trillion](http://www.pagetutor.com/trillion/index.html) either.
