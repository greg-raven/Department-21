By following simple advice heard on the Oprah show, you too can find inner peace. Dr. Oz proclaimed, “The way to achieve inner peace is to finish all the things you have started and have never finished.”  
  
So, I looked around my house to see all the things I started and hadn’t finished, and before leaving the house this morning, I finished off a bottle of White Zinfandel, a bottle of Tequila, a package of Oreos, the remainder of my old Prozac prescription, the rest of the cheesecake, some Doritos, and a box of chocolates. You have no idea how good I feel right now.

The Dr. was right.
