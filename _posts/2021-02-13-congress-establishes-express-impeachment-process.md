After failing twice at impeaching Donald Trump, the House today announced a new Express process for targets of impeachment with three Articles or less.

The new process is designed to expedite impeachment trials so that they can take place before the offender leaves office, as specified in the Constitution, making heavy use of "lightning rounds" to reduce the amount of time given to the defense team for its presentation.

The new process retains some of the characteristics of the traditional impeachment process, such as that those impeached via the Express process still can be considered impeached forever.
