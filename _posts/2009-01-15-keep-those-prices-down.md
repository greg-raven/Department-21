1,330,044,544 Chinese walk into a bar, and each orders a gin and tonic. The bartender serves them, and charges them $24 apiece.

After collecting the money, the bartender says to them, “We don’t see many Chinese around here.”

The Chinese reply in unison, “At these prices, you won’t see many more.”
