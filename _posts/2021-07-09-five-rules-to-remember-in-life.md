1. Forgive your enemy but remember his name.
2. Money cannot buy happiness but it’s more comfortable to cry in a Mercedes than on a bicycle.
3. Help someone when they are in trouble and they will remember you when they’re in trouble again.
4. Many persons are alive only because it’s illegal to shoot them.
5. Alcohol does not solve any problems, but then, neither does milk.
