Hey! Get back indoors.  
Whatever you were doing  
Could put an eye out.

A lovely nose ring —  
excuse me while I put my  
head in the oven.

Hidden connection —  
starvation in Africa,  
food left on my plate.

How soft the petals  
of the floral arrangement  
I have just stolen.

My nature journal —  
today, I saw some trees and birds.  
I should know the names?

Add cholesterol  
then overcook and serve with bread:  
recipe revealed.

Like a bonsai tree,  
your terrible posture at  
my dinner table.

Coroner's report —  
"The deceased, wearing no hat,  
caught his death of cold."

Lonely mantra of  
the Buddhist monk: "They never  
call, they never write."

The sparkling blue sea  
beckons me to wait one hour  
after my sandwich.

Concert of car horns  
as we debate the question  
of when to change lanes.

Is one Nobel Prize  
too much to ask from a child  
after all I've done?

Sorry I'm not home  
to take your call. At the tone  
please state your bad news.
