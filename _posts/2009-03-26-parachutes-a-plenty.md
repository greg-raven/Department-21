An airplane was about to crash, and there were 5 passengers left, but only 4 parachutes. The first passenger, Barack Obama says, “I am president of the United States, and I have a great responsibility, being the leader of nearly 300 million people, and a superpower, etc.,” so he takes the first parachute, and jumps out of the plane.

The second passenger, said “I’m Antoine Walker, one the best NBA Basketball players, and the Boston Celtics need me, so I can’t afford to die,” so he takes the second parachute, and leaves the plane.

The third passenger, Michelle Obama, said “I am the wife of the President of the United States, and I am the smartest woman in the world,” so she takes the third parachute and exits the plane.

The fourth passenger, Pope John Paul the Second, says to the fifth passenger, a 10-year-old Boy Scout, “I am old and frail and I don’t have many years left, so as a Christian gesture and good deed, I will sacrifice my life and let you take the last parachute.” The Boy Scout said, “It’s OK, there’s still a parachute for each of us. The world’s smartest woman took my backpack.”
