With a very seductive voice, a woman asked her husband, “Have you ever seen twenty dollars all crumpled up?”

“No,” he said.

She gave him a sexy little smile, unbuttoned the top three buttons of her blouse and slowly reached down in her cleavage created by a soft, silky push-up bra and pulled out a crumpled twenty dollar bill.

He took the crumpled twenty dollar bill from her and smiled approvingly.

She then asked, “Have you ever seen fifty dollars all crumpled up?”

“No, I haven’t,” he said with an anxious tone in his voice.

She gave him another sexy little smile pulled up her skirt, seductively reached into her tight, sheer panties and pulled out a crumpled fifty dollar bill.

He took the crumpled fifty dollar bill and started breathing a little quicker with anticipation.

“Now,” she said, “Have you ever seen 50,000 dollars all crumpled up?”

“No way!” he said, becoming even more aroused and excited, to which she replied:

“Go look in the garage.”
