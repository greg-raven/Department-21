A few minutes before the church services started, the congregation was sitting in their pews and talking. Suddenly, Satan appeared at the front of the church. Everyone started screaming and running for the front entrance, trampling each other in a frantic effort to get away from evil incarnate.

Soon the church was empty except for Bill Clinton who sat calmly in his pew without moving, seemingly oblivious to the fact that God's ultimate enemy was in his presence.

So Satan walked up to Bill and said, "Do you know who I am?"

The Clinton replied, "Yep, sure do."

"Aren't you afraid of me?" Satan asked.

"Nope, sure ain't." said the calm as a clam Clinton.

"Don't you realize I can kill you with one word?" asked Satan.

"Don't doubt it for a minute," returned Bill, in an even tone.

"Did you know that I can cause you profound, horrifying agony for all eternity?" persisted Satan.

"Yep," was the calm reply.

"And you are still not afraid?" asked Satan.

"Nope," said Bill.

More than a little perturbed, Satan asked, "Why aren't you afraid of me?"

Bill Clinton calmly replied, "Been married to your sister for over 40 years."
