I was thinking: If only 11 million people have Obamacare, how will 24 million people die if it is repealed? Will an additional 13 million people be randomly shot?

I was thinking: If Donald Trump deleted all of his emails, wiped his server with Bleach Bit and destroyed all of his phones with a hammer, would the mainstream media suddenly lose all interest in the story and declare him innocent.

I was thinking: If women do the same job for less money, why do companies hire men to do the same job for more money?

I was thinking: If you rob a bank in a Sanctuary City, is it illegal or is it just an undocumented withdrawal?

I was thinking: Each ISIS attack now is a reaction to Trump policies, but all ISIS attacks during Obama’s term were due to Climate Change and a plea for jobs.

I was thinking: We should stop calling them all ‘Entitlements.’ Welfare, Food Stamps, and WIC are not entitlements. They are taxpayer-funded handouts, and shouldn’t be called entitlements at all. Social Security and Veterans Benefits are entitlements because the people receiving them are entitled to them. They were earned and paid for by the recipients.

I was thinking: If Muslims leave a Muslim country, does that mean they’re Islamophobic?

I was thinking: If Liberals don’t believe in biological gender then why did they march for women’s rights?

I was thinking: How did the Russians get Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC to steal the Primary from Bernie Sanders? How did Russia get Donna Brazile to leak debate questions to Hillary Clinton in advance of the debates?

I was thinking: Why is it that Democrats think Super delegates are fine, but they have a problem with the Electoral College?

I was thinking: If you don’t want the FBI involved in elections, don’t nominate someone who’s being investigated by the FBI.

I was thinking: If Hillary’s speeches cost $250,000 an hour, how come no one shows up to her free ones?

I was thinking: The DNC is mad at Russia because they ‘think’ they were trying to manipulate our election by exposing that the DNC manipulated the last presidential election.

I was thinking: If Democrats don’t want foreigners involved in our elections, why do they campaign in Spanish and think it’s alright for illegals to vote?
