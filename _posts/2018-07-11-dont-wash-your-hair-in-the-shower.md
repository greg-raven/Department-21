A health warning you can actually use

I don’t know why I didn’t figure this out sooner. I use shampoo in the shower. When I wash my hair, the shampoo runs down my whole body. Yet, printed very clearly on the label is this warning:

> For extra body and volume.

No wonder I have been gaining weight!

I don’t want to be seen as offering medical advice, but I got rid of that shampoo and started washing my hair with Dawn dishwashing soap. Its label says:

> Dissolves fat that is otherwise difficult to remove.

Problem solved.

(If you can’t reach me for the next couple of days, it’s because I’ll be in the shower.)
