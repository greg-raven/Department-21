We received about 20 inches of snow this week. So ...

8:00 --- I made a snowman.

8:10 --- A feminist passed by and asked me why I didn't make a snow woman.

8:15 --- So, I made a snow woman.

8:17 --- My feminist neighbor complained about the snow woman's voluptuous chest saying it objectified women everywhere.

8:20 --- The gay couple living nearby threw a hissy fit and moaned it should have been two snowmen instead.

8:22 --- The transgender man / woman / person asked why I didn't just make one snow person with detachable parts.

8:25 --- The vegans at the end of the lane complained about the carrot nose, as veggies are food and are not to be used to decorate snow figures.

8:28 --- I was being called a racist because the snow person is white.

8:30 --- I used food coloring to make the snow person a different color and be more racially inclusive.

8:37 --- Then I was accused of using a black face on the snow person.

8:39 --- The middle eastern gent across the road demanded the snow woman be completely covered.

8:40 --- The police arrived saying someone had been offended.

8:42 --- The feminist neighbor complained again that the broomstick of the snow woman needed to be removed because it depicted women in a domestic role.

8:43 --- The 'council on equality' officer arrived and threatened me with eviction.

8:45 --- TV news crew from ABC showed up. I was asked if I know the difference between snowmen and snow-women? I replied, "Snowballs," and am now a sexist.

9:00 --- I was on the news as a suspected terrorist, racist, homophobe, and sensibility offender, bent on stirring up trouble during difficult weather.

9:10 --- I was asked if I have any accomplices. My children were taken by social services.

9:29 --- Far-left protesters --- offended by everything --- marched down the street demanding that I be arrested.

9:45 --- The boss called and fired me because of the negative association with work that had been all over social media.

10:00 --- I cry into my drink because all I wanted to do was build a snowman ...

Moral: There is no moral to this story. It is what this world has become because of a bunch of snowflakes.
