Our plan gives anyone 65 years or older a gun and a bullet.  
  
You are allowed to shoot any senator and or representative you want.

Of course, this means you will be sent to prison, but there you will get three meals a day, a roof over your head, and all the health care you need!

New teeth, no problem. Need glasses, great. New hip, knees, kidney, lungs, heart? All covered, and your kids can come and visit you as often as they do now.

Who will be paying for all of this? The same government that now tells you that you are too old for health care. Plus, because you are a prisoner, you donâ€™t have to pay any income taxes anymore.

Is this a great country or what?
