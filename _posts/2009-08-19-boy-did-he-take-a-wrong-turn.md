A spaceship landed one day on Earth, and a little green man got out. Addressing a curious passer-by, he said, “Take me to your leader.”  
  
The passer-by whipped out his cell phone, called 911, and sure enough, an armored SUV soon arrived with a government representative.

The government man walked over to the little green alien and asked, “What do YOU want?”

The little green man immediately answered, “I want peace on Earth and goodwill toward men.”

The government representative thought for a minute, and then replied, “We are the United States Government. We don’t do that sort of thing.”
