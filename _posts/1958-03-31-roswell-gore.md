Here's something everyone should know:

On July 8, 1947, witnesses claim a spaceship with five aliens aboard crashed
on a sheep-and-cattle ranch outside Roswell, NM ... an incident they say has
been covered up by the military.

On March 31, 1948, exactly nine months after that day, Al Gore was born.

That clears up a lot of things.
