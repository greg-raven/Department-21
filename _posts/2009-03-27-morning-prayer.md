Dear God:

So far today, I am doing all right. I have not gossiped, lost my temper, been greedy, grumpy, nasty, selfish, or self indulgent. I have not whined, bitched, cursed, or eaten any chocolate. I have not charged anything on my credit card.

However, I am going to get out of bed in a few minutes, and I will need a lot more help after that.

Amen.
