- Blaming your farts on me. Not funny â€¦ not funny at all !!!

- Yelling at me for barking. I'M A FRIGGIN' DOG!!

- Taking me for a walk, then not letting me check stuff out. Exactly whose walk is this anyway?

- Any trick that involves balancing food on my nose. Stop it!

- Any haircut that involves bows or ribbons. Now you know why we chew your stuff up when you're not home.

- The sleight of hand, fake fetch throw. You fooled a dog! Whoooo hoooooooo! What a proud moment for the top of the food chain.

- Taking me to the vet for "the big snip," then acting surprised when I freak out every time we go back!

- Getting upset when I sniff the crotches of your guests. Sorry, but I haven't quite mastered that handshake thing yet.

- Dog sweaters. Hello??? Haven't you noticed the fur?

- How you act disgusted when I lick myself. Look, we both know you're just jealous.
