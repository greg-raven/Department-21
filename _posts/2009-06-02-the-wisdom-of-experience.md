Now that I'm older, here's what I've discovered:

- I started out with nothing, I still have most of it.

- My wild oats have turned to prunes and All Bran.

- I finally got my head together, now my body is falling apart.

- Funny, I don't remember being absent minded.

- All reports are in. Life is now officially unfair.

- If all is not lost, where is it?

- It is easier to get older than it is to get wiser.

- Some days you're the dog, some days you're the hydrant.

- I wish the buck stopped here. I sure could use a few …

- Kids in the back seat cause accidents; accidents in the back seat cause kids.

- It's hard to make a comeback when you haven't been anywhere.

- Only time the world beats a path to your door is if you're in the bathroom.

- If God wanted me to touch my toes, he would have put them on my knees.

- When I'm finally holding all the cards, why does everyone decide to play chess?

- It's not hard to meet expenses … they're everywhere.

- The only difference between a rut and a grave is the depth.

God grant me the Senility to forget the people I never liked anyway, the good fortune to run into the ones I do, and the eyesight to tell the difference. Amen
