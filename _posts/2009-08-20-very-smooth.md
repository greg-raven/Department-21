I was in the pub yesterday when I suddenly realized I desperately needed to fart.  
  
The music was really, really loud, so I timed my farts with the beat.

After a couple of songs, I started to feel better. I finished my beer and noticed that everybody was staring at me.

Then I suddenly remembered that I was listening to my iPod.
