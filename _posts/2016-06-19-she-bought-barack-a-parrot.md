During a lull between the speeches at the recent White House Correspondents’ dinner, Michelle Obama leans over to chat with Joe Biden.

“Ya know, I bought Barack a parrot for his birthday. The bird is so smart, Barack has already taught him to pronounce over two hundred words!”

“Wow, that’s pretty impressive,” says Joe, “but, you do realize that he just speaks the words — he doesn’t really understand what they mean.“

“Oh, I know,” Michelle replied. “Neither does the parrot.”
