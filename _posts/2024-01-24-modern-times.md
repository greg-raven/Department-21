You have a list of 15 phone numbers to reach your family of three.

You chat several times a day with a stranger from South Africa, but you haven't spoken with your next-door neighbor yet this year.

You didn't give your valentine a card this year, but you posted one for your e-mail buddies via a web page.

You call your son's beeper to let him know it's time to eat. He e-mails you back from his bedroom, "What's for dinner?"

Your grandmother clogs up your e-mail inbox asking you to send her a JPEG file of your newborn so she can create a screen saver.

You pull into your driveway and use your cell phone to see if anyone is home.

Cleaning up the dining room means getting the fast food bags out of the back seat of your car.
