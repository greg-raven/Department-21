After dying in a car crash, three friends go to Heaven for orientation. They are all asked the same question: “When you are in your casket and friends and family are mourning upon you, what would you like to hear them say about you?”

The first guy immediately responds, “I would like to hear them say that I was one of the great doctors of my time, and a great family man.”

The second guy says, “I would like to hear that I was a wonderful husband and school teacher who made a huge difference in our children of tomorrow.”

The last guy thinks a minute and replies, “I would like to hear them say, ‘LOOK, HE’S MOVING!!!!!’”
