'Twas the night before spending,<br>
and all through the House,<br>
No one's courage was stirring,<br>
Every man a louse.

The purses were hung by the chimneys with care<br>
In hopes that St. Porkulus soon would be there.<br>
Each member was nestled, all snug in their beds<br>
While delusions of grandeur danced in their heads.<br>
Pelosi in kerchief, and Jeffries in cap<br>
Were anticipating a post-spending nap.

Then out on the 'Net there arose such a twitter,<br>
They sprang to their phones to see comments so bitter.<br>
Away to the pundits they flew like a flash<br>
To shape the news cycle, and argue for cash.<br>
Smooth talk on the crest of a media wave<br>
Gave a luster of kindness to taxes they craved.

When what should their wondering eyes come to see,<br>
But a gigantic bill, too lengthy to read,<br>
With new regulations so unnecessary<br>
Driving up costs for each Tom, Dick, and Harry.

More rapid than income, the earmarks they came<br>
And they whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:<br>
Now highways, now airports! Now railroads and bridges!<br>
Spend trillions, get stupid! Let's hide behind fixes!

From the heights of the north<br>
To the palm trees so tall<br>
Now spend away, spend away, spend away all!<br>
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<br>
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;<br>
So up through the ceiling, the debt dollars flew<br>
And the House they all cheered --- and St. Porkulus too.

And then in a twinkle, I heard at the Fed<br>
The gasp of an economy going dead.<br>
As I cradled my head in my tired old hands,<br>
Through the west doors St. Porkulus came with a bam!<br>
He was dressed all in furs, from his head to his foot<br>
And his clothes were all garnished with ill-gotten loot.<br>
A bundle of cash he had flung on his back<br>
And he looked like a peddler --- but nothing he lacked.<br>
His eyes --- how they twinkled! His dimples how merry!<br>
Yet his lack of awareness was truly quite scary.

His wry little mouth was drawn up in a grin,<br>
As he straightened the tie underneath his wide chin.<br>
A pipe that burned dollars he held in his teeth,<br>
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;<br>
He had a broad face and a corpulent tummy,<br>
That shook when he laughed, though I found nothing funny.<br>
He was chubby and plump, that huge fattened old imp,<br>
And I cried when I saw him, my shoulders hung limp.

A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,<br>
Reminded me we have bankruptcy to dread.

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work:<br>
Emptied all the stockings, then turned with a jerk,<br>
And placing his thumb on the tip of his nose<br>
With fingers outspread, out the doorway he strode.

He sprang to his limo, his team gave a whistle,<br>
And away they all drove like a fiscal cruise missile.<br>
But I heard him exclaim, as he drove out of sight,<br>
"Happy spending to us! Keep your own budgets tight!"
