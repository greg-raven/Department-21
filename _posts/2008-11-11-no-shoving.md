A little girl, dressed in her Sunday best, was running as fast as she could, trying not to be late for Sunday School. As she ran she prayed, "Dear Lord, please don't let me be late! Please don't let me be late!"

As she was running &amp; praying, she tripped on a curb and fell, getting her clothes dirty &amp; tearing her dress. She got up, brushed herself off and started running again.

As she ran once again she began to pray, "Dear Lord, please don't let me be late! But don't shove me either.
