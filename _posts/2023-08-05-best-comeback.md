A defense attorney was cross-examining a police officer during a felony trial.

**Q:** Officer, did you see my client fleeing the scene?

**A:** No sir, but I subsequently observed a person matching the description of the offender running several blocks away.

**Q:** Officer, who provided this description?

**A:** The officer who responded to the scene. A fellow officer provided the description of this so-called offender.

**Q:** Do you trust your fellow officers?

**A:** Yes sir, with my life.

**Q:** With your life? Let me ask you this then, officer: Do you have a locker room in the police station â€” a room where you change your clothes in preparation for your daily duties?

**A:** Yes sir, we do.

**Q:** And do you have a locker in that room?

**A:** Yes sir, I do.

**Q:** And do you have a lock on your locker?

**A:** Yes sir.

**Q:** Now why is it, officer, if you trust your fellow officers with your life, that you find it necessary to lock your locker in a room you share with those same officers?

**A:** You see sir, we share the building with a court complex, and sometimes lawyers have been known to walk through that room.

With that, the courtroom erupted in laughter, and a prompt recess was called.

The officer on the stand has been nominated for this year's "Best Comeback" line and we think he'll win.
