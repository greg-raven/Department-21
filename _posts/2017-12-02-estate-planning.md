Tom was a single guy living at home with his father and working in the family business.

He had never been very motivated because knew that he would inherit a fortune once his father died, and his father had lately fallen on ill health.

Still, Tom had two goals:

- To learn how to invest his inheritance.

- To find a wife to share his fortune.

One evening at an investment meeting, he spotted the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. Her natural beauty took his breath away.

"I may look like just an ordinary man," he said to her, "But when my father passes away, I stand to inherit 200 million dollars."

Impressed, the woman obtained his business card.

Two weeks later, she became his stepmother.

Moral: Women are so much better at estate planning than men.
