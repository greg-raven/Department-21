An elderly couple was traveling in Jerusalem, and during their visit, the wife died.  
  
The mortician informed the husband that with all the expenses and fees, it would cost at least $5,000 to ship his wife back to the United States for burial. However, if he wanted, he could have her buried in Jerusalem for $125.

The man thought for a moment, and then said, "Please prepare her to be shipped home."

Puzzled, the mortician asked, "Why not bury her here and save the money?"

The man replied, "The only person I knew who was buried in Jerusalem came back to life three days later. I'm just not willing to take that chance."
