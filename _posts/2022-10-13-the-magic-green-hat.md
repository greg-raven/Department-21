Visiting in Florida last week, I needed to go to the emergency room for a pain in my side. Not wanting to sit there for several hours, I put on my MAGIC GREEN HAT.

When I went into the E.R., I noticed that 3/4 of the people in the room got up and left. I guess they decided that they weren’t that sick after all. It cut at least 3 hours off my waiting time.

It also works at Dept. of Motor Vehicles. It saved me several hours.

At the Laundromat, three minutes after entering, I had my choice of any machine, most still running.

It might also cut your wait time at the grocery store.

But…don’t try it at McDonald’s… The whole crew ran out the back door and I never did get my order!

Here’s the hat:
