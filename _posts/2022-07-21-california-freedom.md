Freedom is under attack.

In your state, dictator Ron DeSantis incredibly lets you walk around without masks. That tyrant allows your kids to go to school during the pandemic year two or four or who the hell knows. I urge you living in Florida to join the fight or join us in California, where we’ll take the money you earn and give it to people who don’t work.

Visit San Francisco, where you can walk through human feces. If you’re lucky, you might step on a syringe. Check out Los Angeles where gas is so expensive your kids only need to skip a meal or two or ten to afford it.

California where freedom means lockdowns for you while I go to the places you can’t afford. Don’t let them take your freedom. Come to California, where we’ll take it, along with your money.
