Two guys out hunting came upon a huge hole in the ground. They approached it and were amazed at its size.

The first hunter said, "Wow, that's some hole. I can't even see the bottom. I wonder how deep it is?"

The second hunter said, "I don't know. Let's throw something down there, listen, and see how long it takes to hit bottom."

The first hunter said, "Hey, there's an old automobile transmission over there. If you give me a hand we can throw that in."

So they picked up the transmission, carried it over to the hole, counted one-two-three, and heaved it in. They were standing there looking over the edge of the hole and listening when they heard a rustling behind them. As they turned around, a goat came crashing through the underbrush, ran up to the hole, and, without hesitation, jumped in head first.

They stood there for several minutes staring at each other in amazement and peering into the hole, trying to comprehend what they had just seen.

Just then an old farmer sauntered up. "Say there," said the farmer, "you fellers didn't happen to see my goat around here anywhere, did you?"

The first hunter said, "Funny you should ask. We were just standing here a minute ago, and a goat came running out of the bushes doing about a hundred miles an hour and jumped head-first into this here hole!"

The old farmer said, "Naw, that's impossible. I had him chained to a transmission."
