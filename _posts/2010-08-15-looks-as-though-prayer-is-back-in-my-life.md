I was in slow-moving traffic the other day and the car in front of me had a bumper sticker on it that read:

“Pray for Obama. Psalm 109:8”  
  
When I got home, I looked up that Bible passage. It read:

Psalm 109:8 — “Let his days be few and brief; and let others step forward to replace him.”

Let us all bow our heads and pray.
