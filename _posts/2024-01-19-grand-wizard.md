The southern preacher rose with a red face. "Someone in this congregation has spread a rumor that I belong to the KKK This is a horrible lie and one which a Christian community cannot tolerate. I am embarrassed and do not intend to accept this. Now I want the party who did this to stand and ask forgiveness from God and this Christian family."

"Reverend there has been a terrible misunderstanding. I never said you were a member of the Ku Klux Klan. I told a couple of my friends that you were a wizard under the sheets!"
