President Trump invited the Pope for lunch on his yacht. While they were eating, a puff of wind blew the Pontiff's hat off, right into the water.

Fortunately it floated, but it was almost 50 feet away from the ship.

The crew and the secret service were scrambling to launch a boat to go get it, when Trump waved them off, saying "Never mind, boys, I'll get it."

The Donald climbed over the side of the yacht, walked on the water to the hat, picked it up, walked back on the water, climbed onto the yacht, and handed the Pope his hat.

The crew was speechless. The security team was speechless. The Pope's entourage was speechless.

No one knew what to say, not even the Pope.

But that afternoon, NBC, CBS, ABC, MSNBC, CNN all knew how to cover the story. Their banner headlines read, "TRUMP CAN'T SWIM!"
