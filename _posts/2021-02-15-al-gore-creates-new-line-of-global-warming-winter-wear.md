Nobel Peace Prize Al Gore, former U.S. Senator and Vice-President of the United States, and founder and current chair of The Climate Reality Project, today announced his new line of Global Warming winter wear.

The clothing line, which will go on sale this summer under the name of GoreTax, features special expanding fibers that trap all light while still emitting heat, and are easily rechargeable to provide the wearer with a comforting feeling of being utterly detached from climate reality.
