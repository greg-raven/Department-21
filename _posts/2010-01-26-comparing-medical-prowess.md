A small group of doctors from around the world is comparing notes at a medical convention.  
  
An Israeli doctor says, "Medicine in my country is so advanced that we can take a kidney out of one man, put it in another, and have him looking for work in six weeks."

A German doctor says, "That is nothing; we can take a lung out of one person, put it in another, and have him looking for work in four weeks."

A Russian doctor says, "In my country, medicine is so advanced that we can take half a heart out of one person, put it in another, and have them both looking for work in two weeks."

An American doctor says, "You guys are way behind. We recently took a man with no brains out of Illinois , put him in the White House and within SIX MONTHS, half the country is looking for work.
