I have kleptomania, but when it gets bad, I take something for it.

Follow your dreams --- except that one where you're naked in church.

The Lovers are Swiss

And

It's all organized by the Italians.

In Memoriam:

With all the sadness and trauma going on in the world at the moment, it is worth reflecting on the death of a very important person, which almost went unnoticed last week.

And then the trouble started.

Answering, he heard his wife's voice urgently warning him, "Herman, I just heard on the news that there's a car going the wrong way on 280 Interstate. Please be careful!" "It's not just one car," said Herman. "It's hundreds of them!"

Don't sweat the petty things. Don't pet the sweaty things.

Corduroy pillows are making headlines!

I want to die while asleep like my grandfather. Not screaming in terror like the passengers in his car.
