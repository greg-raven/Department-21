The next time you hear a politician use the word "billion" in a casual manner, think about whether you want politicians spending YOUR tax money.

A billion is a difficult number to comprehend, but one advertising agency did a good job of putting that figure into some perspective in one of its releases.

- A billion seconds ago it was 1959.

- A billion minutes ago Jesus was alive.

- A billion hours ago our ancestors were living in the Stone Age.

- A billion days ago nothing walked the earth on two feet.

- A billion dollars ago was only 8 hours and 20 minutes, at the rate our government is spending it.

While this thought is still fresh in our brain, let's take a look at the situation in New Orleans. It's amazing what you can learn with some simple division.

Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu (D) was asking Congress for 250 billion dollars to rebuild New Orleans.

What does that mean?

If you are one of the 484,674 residents of New Orleans, you get $516,528.

Or, if you have one of the 188,251 homes in New Orleans, your home gets $1,329,787.

Or, if you are a family of four, your family gets $2,066,012.

This is YOUR money, not the government's! They got it through:

- Accounts Receivable Tax

- Building Permit Tax

- CDL License Tax

- Cigarette Tax

- Corporate Income Tax

- Dog License Tax

- Federal Income Tax

- Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA)

- Fishing License Tax

- Food License Tax

- Fuel Permit Tax

- Gasoline Tax

- Hunting License Tax

- Inheritance Tax

- Inventory Tax

- IRS Interest Charges (tax on top of tax)

- IRS Penalties (tax on top of tax)

- Liquor Tax

- Service charge taxes

- Social Security Tax

- Road Usage Tax (Truckers)

- State Unemployment Tax (SUTA)

- Telephone Federal Excise Tax

- Telephone Recurring and Non-recurring Charges Tax

- Telephone State and Local Tax

- Telephone Usage Charge Tax

- Utility Tax

- Vehicle License Registration Tax

- Vehicle Sales Tax

- Watercraft Registration Tax

- Well Permit Tax

- Workers Compensation Tax

(And don't forget inflation: The hidden tax.)

Not one of these taxes existed 100 years ago, and our nation was the most prosperous in the world.

We had absolutely no national debt, we had the largest middle class in the world, and Mom stayed home to raise the kids.
