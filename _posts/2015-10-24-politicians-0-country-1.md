A bus loaded with politicians was driving down a country road one afternoon, when it ran off the road and crashed into a tree in an old farmer's field.

Seeing what happened, the old farmer went over to investigate. He then dug a hole and buried the politicians.

A while later, the local sheriff came out, saw the burned-out hulk of the crashed bus, and asked the old farmer, "Were there any survivors?"

The old farmer replied, "Well, some of them said they were alive, but you know how them politicians lie."
