36 have been accused of spousal abuse  
  
7 have been arrested for fraud

19 have been accused of writing bad checks

117 have directly or indirectly bankrupted at least 2 businesses

3 have done time for assault

71 — repeat 71 — cannot get a credit card due to bad credit

14 have been arrested on drug-related charges

8 have been arrested for shoplifting

21 currently are defendants in lawsuits, and

84 have been arrested for drunk driving in the last year

Can you guess which organization this is? Is it the NBA or NFL?

Neither, it’s the 535 members of the United States Congress, the same group of criminals that crank out hundreds of new laws each year for the rest of us.
