Picture yourself near a stream …

Birds are softly chirping in the crisp, cool mountain air …

Nothing can bother you here …

No one knows this secret place …

You are in total seclusion from that place called The World …

The soothing sound of a gentle waterfall fills the air with a cascade of serenity …

The water is crystal clear …

You can easily make out the face of the person whose head you're holding under the water …

There now … feeling better?
