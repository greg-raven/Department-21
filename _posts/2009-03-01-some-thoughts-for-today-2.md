- Transvestite: A guy who likes to eat, drink and be Mary.

- The difference between the Pope and your boss: The Pope only expects you to kiss his ring.

- My mind works like lightning: One brilliant flash and it is done.

- The only time the world beats a path to your door is if you're in the bathroom.

- I hate sex in the movies. Tried it once. The seat folded up, the drink spilled and that ice, well, it really chilled the mood.

- It used to be only death and taxes. Now, of course, there's shipping and handling, too.

- A husband is someone who, after taking the trash out, gives the impression that he just cleaned the whole house.

- My next house will have no kitchen --- just vending machines and a large trash can.

- A blonde said, "I was worried that my mechanic might try to rip me off. I was relieved when he told me all I needed was turn signal fluid."

- Definition of a teenager? God's punishment for enjoying sex.

- My idea of a Super Bowl is a toilet that cleans itself.
