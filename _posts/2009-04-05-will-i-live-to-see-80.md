I recently picked a new primary care doctor. After two visits and exhaustive Lab tests, he said I was doing “fairly well” for my age. (I just turned 49.)

A little concerned about that comment, I couldn’t resist asking him, “Do you think I’ll live to be 80?”

He asked, “Do you smoke tobacco, or drink beer or wine?”

“Oh no,” I replied. “I”m not doing drugs, either!”

Then he asked, “Do you eat rib-eye steaks or barbecued ribs?”

I said, “Not very often. My former doctor said that red meat is very unhealthy!”

“Do you spend a lot of time in the sun: Playing golf, sailing, hiking, or bicycling?”

“No, I don’t,” I said.

He asked, “Do you gamble, drive fast cars, or have a lot of sex?”

“No,” I said.

He looked at me and asked, “Then, why do you even care?
