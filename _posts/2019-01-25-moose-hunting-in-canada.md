Two hunters, Otis and Elmer, got a pilot to fly them into the Canadian wilderness where they managed to bag two big bull moose.

As they were loading the plane to return, the pilot said the plane could take only the hunters, their gear, and one moose.

The hunters objected strongly saying, "Last year we shot two, and the pilot let us take them both ... and he had exactly the same airplane as yours."

The pilot, not wanting to be outdone by a competitor, reluctantly gave in and everything was loaded.

However, even under full power, the little plane couldn't handle the load and went down, crashing in the wooded wilderness.

Somehow, surrounded by the moose, clothing, and sleeping bags, Otis and Elmer survived the crash.

After climbing out of the wreckage, Otis asked, "Any idea where we are?"

Elmer replied, "I think we're pretty close to where we crashed last year."
