Hillary Clinton phoned the White House shortly after midnight.

“I need to talk to the president, it’s an emergency!” exclaimed Hillary.

After some cajoling, the president’s assistant agreed to wake him up.

“So, what is it that’s so important that it can’t wait until morning?” grumbled Trump.

“Ruth Bader Ginsburg just died and I want to take her place,” begged Hillary.

“Well, it’s okay with me if it’s okay with the mortuary,” replied President Trump.
