The Easterner had always dreamed of owning his own cattle ranch, and finally made enough money to buy himself the spread of his dreams in Wyoming.

“So, what did you name the ranch?” asked his best friend when he flew out to visit.

“We had a heck of a time,” admitted the new cowboy. “Couldn’t agree on anything. We finally settled on the ‘Double R Lazy L Triple Horseshoe Bar-7 Lucky Diamond Ranch’.”

“Wow!” his friend was impressed. “So where are all the cows?”

“None of ’em survived the branding.”
