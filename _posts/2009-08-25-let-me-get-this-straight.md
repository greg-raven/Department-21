Obama's health care plan will:

- Be written by a committee whose head says he doesn't understand it;

- Be passed by a Congress that hasn't read it (but exempts themselves from it);

- Be signed by a person who smokes (and also hasn't read it), and who is married to a
woman who as a hospital administrator made hundreds of thousands of dollars per year --- in part --- for kicking indigent patients out into the cold;

- Have funding administered by a treasury chief who did not pay his taxes;

- Be overseen by a surgeon general who is obese; and

- Be financed by a country that is nearly broke.

What could possibly go wrong?
