This Dodge truck belongs to a hard-core drinker.

The driver hit and sheared off the light post, and then a couple more miles to a bar, where he stopped for more beer!

How impaired do you have to be not to notice that you are carrying a stop light? (Maybe the light was green?)

The truck was towed a couple more miles to the towing yard, with the light still pinched between the two tow hooks and the bumper bent around it. It took several good hard pulls with a backhoe to get the pole free.
