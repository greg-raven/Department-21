I was in the McDonald's drive-through the other day, and the young lady behind me leaned on her horn because I was taking too long to place my order.

"Take the high road," I thought to myself. So when I got to the first window, I paid for her order along with my own.

The cashier must have told her what I'd done, because as we moved up she leaned out her window and waved to me and mouthed "thank you," obviously embarrassed that I had repaid her rudeness with a kindness.

When I got to the second window, I showed them both receipts and took her food, too.

Now she has to go back to the end of the line and start all over.

Don't honk your horn at old people.
