Is it just me, or does anyone else find it amazing that during the mad cow epidemic our government could track a single cow, born in Canada almost three years ago, right to the stall where she slept in the state of Washington? And they tracked her calves to their stalls. Somehow, though, they are unable to locate 20 million illegal aliens wandering around our country.  
  
Maybe we should give each of them a cow.
