It is now official: You are all morons.

The U.S. Postal Service was established in 1775 --- you have had 234 years to get it right; it is broke.

Social Security was established in 1935 --- you have had 74 years to get it right; it is broke.

Fannie Mae was established in 1938 --- you have had 71 years to get it right; it is broke.

War on Poverty started in 1964 --- you have had 45 years to get it right; $1 trillion of our money is confiscated each year and transferred to "the poor"; it hasn't worked.

Medicare and Medicaid were established in 1965 --- you've had 44 years to get it right; they're broke.

Freddie Mac was established in 1970 --- you have had 39 years to get it right; it is broke.

Trillions of dollars in the massive political payoff called the TARP bill of 2009 shows NO sign of working.

And finally to set a new record:

"Cash for Clunkers" was established in 2009 and went broke in 2009! It took good dependable cars (that were the best some people could afford) replaced them with high priced (people who couldn't afford to are now making payments) mostly Japanese models so a good percentage of the profits, from the sales, went out of the country. And lastly, the American taxpayers are now going to be dinged with paying 3 billion more dollars to save a small fraction of that in oil purchases.

So with a perfect 100% failure rate and a record that proves that "services" you shove down our throats are failing faster and faster, you want Americans to believe you can be trusted with a government-run health care system? 15% of our economy? Are you crazy?
