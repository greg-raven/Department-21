A couple were in a busy shopping center just before Christmas. The wife suddenly noticed that her husband was missing and as they had a lot to do, she called him on his cell phone.

When he answered, she asked him, "Where are you? You know we have lots to do."

He replied, "You remember the jewelry store we went into about 10 years ago, where you fell in love with that diamond necklace? I could not afford it at the time and I said that one day I would get it for you?"

Almost speechless, tears started flowing down her cheeks.

"Yes, I remember that shop."

"Well," he said, "I am in the bike shop next to it."
