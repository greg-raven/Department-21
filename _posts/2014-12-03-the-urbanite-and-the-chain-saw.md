An urbanite is looking to get away from it all, so he buys a remote piece of property that has no utilities, although it does have a small cabin with a wood stove. To get wood for the stove, he decides to cut down some of the trees on his property. So, he goes to a hardware store and picks out a hand saw.

The clerk tells him, "Look, I'd be happy to sell you that hand saw, but why don't you save yourself a lot of time and aggrevation and get a chain saw? This chainsaw will cut a hundred cords of wood for you in one day."

That sounds impressive, so the urbanite takes the chainsaw home and begins working on the trees. After cutting for several hours and only cutting two cords, he decides to quit. He thinks there is something wrong with the chain saw. "How can I cut for hours and only cut two cords?" the urbanite asks himself. "I will begin first thing in the morning and cut all day."

So, the next morning the urbanite gets up at 4:00 in the morning and cuts, and cuts, and cuts until nightfall. Still, he manages to cut only five cords.

The very next day the urbanite brings the saw back to the store and explains the problem. The dealer, baffled by the urbanite's claim, removes the chainsaw from the case, examining it. The clerk says, "Huh, it looks fine."

Then the clerk starts the chainsaw, to which the urbanite responds, "What's that noise?"
