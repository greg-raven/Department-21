1. America’s emergency rooms and health care system are not crowded enough.
2. The U.S. needs more organized, violent gangs. Currently the U.S. has Salvadoran gangs; Vietnamese gangs, Filipino gangs, Armenian gangs, Russian gangs, Chinese gangs; Cambodian gangs; Bulgarian gangs, Dominican gangs, Mexican gangs, Haitian gangs. Continuing unrestricted immigration will increase this “diversity.”
3. The U.S. carbon footprint is not large enough. Millions more immigrants will swell the population to enlarge the country’s carbon footprint.
4. U.S. highways are not crowded enough. More traffic is needed.
5. The percentage of U.S. land that is not yet paved over and developed is far too small.
6. Prior to the days of unrestricted immigration the U.S. lacked a sufficient “diversity” of serious diseases. Unrestricted and illegal immigration has remedied that situation by reintroducing diseases formerly wiped out in the US and introducing new ones never before seen here: Leprosy, dengue fever, West Nile virus, treatment resistant TB, polio,
7. The U.S. needs more 9/11 style attacks. The 9/11 mass murderers were able to hide in plain sight among millions of other illegal aliens. In order to help future terrorists we must maintain a massive population of illegals.
8. There is insufficient racial, ethnic, religious strife in the U.S. Immigration will provide a welcome increase.
9. The U.S. does not have enough front groups for Hamas, Hezbollah and other Islamic terrorist organizations. Continued unrestricted immigration will enlarge the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and groups like it to rectify this lack.
10. The demonstrated propensity of Latin-American illegal aliens to drive while drunk will provide the needed increase in DUI’s and additional deaths of innocent people.
11. The ACLU favors illegal immigration.
12. The Sierra Club favors illegal immigration.
13. Rev. Jeremiah Wright and the church to which he belongs (United Church of Christ) favor illegal immigration.
14. The Communist Party and other extreme left wing groups support illegal immigration.
15. Americans who have lived all their lives in the US currently have far too much medical care available to them and their quality of life must be reduced. That reduction can most easily be achieved by legalizing 20 to 30 million illegal aliens so they are eligible for the “free” benefits” of Obama’s scheme. See reason 17
16. America’s schools are not crowded enough.
17. Only fifty-five languages are spoken the Los Angeles public school system. The cost and confusion created by this diversity has lowered quality a great deal, but it is possible to do worse.
18. With millions more poor illegals there will be a greater need for social workers, welfare workers, public school teachers and aides, more school lunch programs, more prisons, more police, more government workers of every kind. This will enlarge the number of voters reliant on the government for paychecks and will swell the membership rolls of the National Education Association, AFSCME, SEIU and other Democrat organizations.
19. The Democrat Party needs more voters.
20. The U.S. needs more socialism/Marxism. Adding tens of millions of poor immigrants demanding taxpayer-paid services guarantees the continued descent into loss of individual liberty.
21. A larger population will make us even more dependent on foreign oil.
22. There is not enough urban sprawl in the U.S.
23. The Catholic Church’s membership is increased by unrestricted immigration.
24. Not enough of Arizona’s citizens have been murdered.
25. Tyson Foods needs more illegal alien employees.
26. George Soros, a Nazi collaborator in World War 2 needs more lawbreakers in the U.S. who are beholden to his many open borders front groups.
27. Illegal alien gangs have not yet murdered enough African-Americans in Southern California. This process of ethnic cleansing is best accomplished by unrestricted immigration.
