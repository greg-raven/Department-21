The grandson smiles weakly and replies, "But Grandpa, I really doana lika guns. Howzabout you leava me you Rolex watch instead?"

Gasping for air, the old man answers with a snarl in his voice, "Shuddup an lissin. Somma day you gonna runna da business. You gonna have a beautifula wife, lotsa money, a biga home, and maybe a a couple of bambinos."

After a slight pause to catch his breath he continues, "Somma day you gonna comma home and maybe find you wife inna bed with another man. Whadda you gonna do then ... pointa to your watch and say 'Time's up'?"
