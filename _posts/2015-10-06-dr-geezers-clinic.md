An old doctor became bored in retirement, so, he decided to open a medical clinic.

He put a sign up outside that said: "Dr. Geezer's Clinic. Treatments $500. If not cured, get back $1,000."

Mr. Young thought this would be a great opportunity to get $1,000, so he went to Dr. Geezer's clinic.

Mr. Young: "Dr. Geezer, I have lost all taste in my mouth. Can you please help me?"

Dr. Geezer: "Nurse, please bring medicine from box 22 and put 3 drops in Mr. Young's mouth."

Mr. Young: "Aaagh!! This is gasoline!"

Dr. Geezer: "Congratulations! You've got your taste back. That will be $500."

Mr. Young gets annoyed and goes back after a couple of days figuring to recover his money.

Mr. Young: "I have lost my memory, I cannot remember anything."

Dr. Geezer: "Nurse, please bring medicine from box 22 and put 3 drops in the patient's mouth."

Mr. Young: "Oh, no you don't, that is gasoline!"

Dr. Geezer: "Congratulations! You've got your memory back. That will be $500."

Now having lost $1,000, Mr. Young leaves angrily, but comes back after several more days.

Mr. Young: "My eyesight has become weak â€” I can hardly see anything!

Dr. Geezer hands Mr. Young a $10 bill, saying "Well, I don't have any medicine for that so, here's $1,000."

Mr. Young: "But this is only $10!"

Dr. Geezer: "Congratulations! You got your vision back! That will be $500."
