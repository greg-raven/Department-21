Does anybody out there recall the reason given for the establishment of the Department of Energy during the Carter administration? Bottom line we've spent several hundred billion dollars in support of an agency the reason for which not one person who reads this can remember. It was very simple and at the time everybody thought it very appropriate: the "Department of Energy" was instituted on 8/4/1977 to lessen our dependence on foreign oil.

Now it's 2009, 32 years later, and the budget for this necessary department is at $24.2 billion a year. It has 16,000 federal employees and approximately 100,000 contract employees, and look at the job it has done! Pretty efficient, huh?

This is where you slap your forehead and say ah, yes, good ole bureaucracy. And now we are going to turn the banking system, health care, and the auto industry over to them?
