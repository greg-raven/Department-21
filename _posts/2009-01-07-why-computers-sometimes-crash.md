If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port,<br>and the bus is interrupted at a very last resort, <br>and the access of the memory makes your floppy disk abort, <br>then the socket packet pocket has an error to report.

If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash, <br>and the double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash, <br>and your data is corrupted cause the index doesn't hash, <br>then your situation's hopeless and your system's gonna crash!

If the label on the cable on the table at your house, <br>says the network is connected to the button on your mouse, <br>but your packets want to tunnel to another protocol, <br>that's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall,

And your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss, <br>so your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse; <br>then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang, <br>'cuz sure as I'm a poet, <br>the sucker's gonna hang.

When the copy on your floppy's getting sloppy in the disk, <br>and the macro code instructions cause unwanted risk, <br>then you'll have to flash the BIOS and you'll want to RAM your ROM, <br>just quickly turn the darn thing off and run to tell your Mom!
