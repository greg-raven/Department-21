In the last six months there have been 292 persons murdered in Chicago, versus 221 killed in Iraq. The leadership in Illinois is all Democrats:

- Senator Barack Obama
- Senator Dick Durbin
- Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.
- Gov. Rod Blogojevich
- House leader Mike Madigan
- Atty. Gen. Lisa Madigan (daughter of Mike)
- Mayor Richard M. Daley (son of Mayor Richard J. Daley)

There are no Republicans to blame.

State pension fund $44 Billion in debt, worst in country.

Cook County (Chicago) sales tax 10.25% highest in country.

Chicago school system rated one of the worst in the country.

This is the political culture that Obama comes from in Illinois. And he’s gonna “fix” Washington politics for us!
